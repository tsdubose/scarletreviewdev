I have always loved to write fiction and poetry. It’s always been like a safe haven for me. Growing up in Brooklyn then moving to Jersey has given me more opportunities. Some of my other passions are dancing and working with children. I plan on getting my Doctorate and having my own clinical practice in my later future.
