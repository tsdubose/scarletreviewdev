## 2
i never really paid attention in geometry class
probably because i was always watching you 
i don't even remember the silly mnemonic 
that seemed insensitive to native americans 
it was something about cosines 
our teacher was a blowhard anyways 

you were fascinated 
by the fact i couldn't ride a bike and 
just like every man after you 
would proclaim you 
were somehow going to teach me 
how to conquer the bicycle 

you also tied my shoes for me 
during study hall when it was just the two of us 
emphasizing the bunny ears 
half smiling when 
i told you that my brain knew 
just that my hands did not

the next year it was chemistry class 
of course we had to be partners 
everyone thought we would shoot up the school 
if they knew either of us they should have expected 
bombs hydrogen bombs 
i would hum the noble gases to myself 
as you stared and stared and stared 

boring twig of a boy 
you were so petrified
enamored by the weird gay kid 
who just had to like you of all people 
i never paid attention in chemistry 

you would drive me home 
and i would cry 
in front of you 
giving blowjobs for rides 
giving up all my integrity 
just to even touch 

you 
played me like a theremin 
telling people stories about
 “your girlfriend” 
we both received an a in chemistry

## A
we would skip lunch 
together to hide in the library 
i would eat my lunch
you would eat nothing 
we were both skeletons 

during american history our obese teacher would do his 
taxes and business inquiries instead of teaching 
so i would play harvest moon and you'd laugh 
at my cows all named after colors 
even though magenta had won me first place at the cow festival 
i named a chicken after you 

we also shared a literature class 
and any opportunity to work together you took it 
and when we had any days in the library 
we would take the computers in the back 
you had your hand on the mouse and mine on your cock

it didn't stop at school 
i would lie to my parents 
taking the train to lindenwold
you would stand at the station smoking a cigarette 
against my abnormal lungs insistence that you shouldn't 
and i shouldn't have followed you into your basement 
and let you play call of duty while i played with your joystick 

your birthday falling three days before christmas made it expensive
i said you have a different birthday jesus 
of course you get two presents 
so i bought you a stupid shirt and vans 
to fit your poser skater persona when you couldn't even land a kickflip 
you had bought me the new harvest moon
i asked if you had any plans for us after graduation 
and you told me that that's when this experiment ends

*“take me home”*
you didn't mean it like that 
*“it's over 
i want to leave”*
you started the ignition 
and we sat in silence for the hour drive home
