To the brightest diamond in a crowded room;
You’ll never know these words are about you
Better to suffer in silence and let it go
Than to risk being a fool and letting shit show

I must admit, you’re quite the lovely illusion
Causing panic, wreaking havoc, all sorts of confusion
Something like Eve giving into sweet sin
And I’m the serpent in your ear urging you to give in

I could tell you you’re beautiful but you’re aware
You’re a pleasant dream, I’m your worst nightmare
I’m sure you have it all so damn simple
Whereas I’m reckless, so tired of being civil

You’re the soft breeze, I’m the pouring rain
Only these obscure words can properly explain
The amount of time I’ve spent thinking about you
Even though I know these fantasies don’t come true

Especially between the princess and the beast
When he saw her first, his hunger did increase
Although the monster knows it's hopeless
She has him trapped well, like hypnosis


Radiant angel, this devil’s full of lust
Strike me down swiftly, express your disgust
Or else keep me here hanging and lingering
Basking in your brilliance, watching you shimmering…
