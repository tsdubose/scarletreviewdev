Dark Side of Show Business","author":"Samantha Spence","layout":"article","headerimage":"img/header-darksideofshowbusiness.jpg","accenttext":"Obviously, the Hollywood community knew about Weinstein. The question is&#58; how did you *not* know about Weinstein?","accentimage":"img/accent-image-darksideofshowbusiness.jpg","_content":"Dear Meryl Streep,\n\nYou are the queen of Hollywood. You are poised, talented, elegant, and an idol to all. You are deeply rooted in the entertainment industry, starring in over fifty major productions throughout your career. You have worked with the biggest stars and producers; but you did not know anything about Harvey Weinstein’s filthy sexual harassment habit? In your well-planned public statement, you walked the fine line of supporting the “intrepid women who raised their voices” while also stating that you “didn’t know about these…offenses” (Ali). But for someone who is arguably one of the biggest stars in Hollywood and a colleague of this man, it’s hard to believe you knew *nothing* of it. Yet, looking at your activism for women’s rights in the past, you seem like the type who would stand with the victims if you did have previous knowledge of the assault.\n\nHarvey Weinstein is being hit with dozens of charges of sexual harassment, ranging from the 1970s to present day 2017. To start off, Cynthia Burr, a well-renowned actress, was one of the earlier victims. She recalls Weinstein coming onto her in an elevator in a hotel, then “[forcing her into] oral sex in a hallway.” She kept the secret for years until she built a name for herself, scared “nobody would have believed [her].” A few years after that incident, Hope Exiner d’Amore suffered being pinned down and raped by Weinstein in a different hotel. In 2004, Ashley Matthau had Weinstein “[masturbate] while straddling her” on a bed after being promised a job in one of his upcoming productions. Matthau was approached by Weinstein a few days later who begged her to stay silent and offered her a bribe. In 2010, two women, Dominique Huett and Mimi Haleyi, came forward on the same day about having “oral sex…forcibly performed on [them]” (Gabler).\n\nMeryl, you have worked on major films with this man, such as *The Iron Lady* and *August: Osage County*, but somehow had no idea that he was sexually abusing your other coworkers (Ali). In fact, you were said to have “happily worked for [Harvey Weinstein]” by Rose McGowan (Ali). These accounts of sexual harassment were happening before, during, and after you worked with Weinstein. Other stars much smaller than yourself have been making jokes about Weinstein and his revolting habits for years. On the television show 30 Rock, one of the characters brags about “[turning] down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions” while her friend warns her that “you can’t stop [Weinstein],” alluding to his harassment and immense power in the business (Fey). At the 2013 Oscars, Seth MacFarlane congratulated the nominees on “no longer [having] to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein” while the audience uncomfortably chuckled (“85th Academy Awards”). Obviously, the Hollywood community knew about Weinstein. The question is: how did you not know about Weinstein?\n\nUnfortunately, Weinstein is not the only sexual predator you have worked with in the past. You worked on the movie *Manhattan* with Woody Allen in 1979. Throughout Allen’s career, it has always been rumored that he was a pedophile. Rumors became factual when his stepdaughter Dylan Farrow detailed Allen sexually abusing her as a child in an open letter (how ironic). Farrow recalls being raped in her attic, being touched in “weird” ways, naked cuddling, and many other inappropriate instances (Farrow). In continuation, you worked with Kevin Spacey on the movie *Heartburn* in 1979. Around this time, Spacey drunkenly forced himself on fourteen-year-old Anthony Rapp at an after-party for a movie premiere. More recently, eight of Spacey’s colleagues from the show *House of Cards* have detailed him as “predatory,” mentioning “nonconsensual touching and crude comments…targeted [at] staffers who were typically young and male.” One assistant described a time when Spacey “put his hands down [the assistant’s] pants” while driving a car. Spacey continued being aggressive and sexual until the assistant vocalized how uncomfortable he was (Melas). Though seeing that you didn’t speak out against these men, it seems as if you weren’t aware of their offenses either.\n\nNow, Meryl, you are known for using your voice. You often promote equality, women’s rights, and vocalize your disgust with President Trump. You use your voice and platform for good, which you should. But why have you not spoken out about all of these sexual predators? Why have you not revealed the disease of sexual harassment in your industry before? From your actions and status in Hollywood, it shows that may have known about the sexual abuse going on. Now, you may not have known about these assaults. Since you are an open feminist and activist for women’s rights, it would make sense that you would fight against these pigs if you did have knowledge of their crimes at the time. Maybe you did find out about these men at the same time the rest of the world did. Maybe these assaults were well-kept between abuser and victim for all of those years.\n\nSome say those who ignore the problem are the problem. In this case, you are a part of the problem if you had previous knowledge of these abuses. If all stars ignored the sexual harassment issue and never shared their stories, predators would have unbelievable control over Hollywood (even more than they do now). These victims need stars like you to rally for them, speak out against predators, and end harassment in your workplace. You need to do more than compliment victims for speaking out in one comment on the Weinstein scandal. You need to stand behind and fight for each victim who bravely shares their story. Your time to speak out is now, after you’ve been enlightened about the assaults, and know both sides of the story.

You are poised, talented, elegant, and an idol to all. You are deeply rooted in the entertainment industry, starring in over fifty major productions throughout your career. You have worked with the biggest stars and producers; but you did not know anything about Harvey Weinstein’s filthy sexual harassment habit? In your well-planned public statement, you walked the fine line of supporting the “intrepid women who raised their voices” while also stating that you “didn’t know about these…offenses” (Ali). But for someone who is arguably one of the biggest stars in Hollywood and a colleague of this man, it’s hard to believe you knew *nothing* of it. Yet, looking at your activism for women’s rights in the past, you seem like the type who would stand with the victims if you did have previous knowledge of the assault.\n\nHarvey Weinstein is being hit with dozens of charges of sexual harassment, ranging from the 1970s to present day 2017. To start off, Cynthia Burr, a well-renowned actress, was one of the earlier victims. She recalls Weinstein coming onto her in an elevator in a hotel, then “[forcing her into] oral sex in a hallway.” She kept the secret for years until she built a name for herself, scared “nobody would have believed [her].” A few years after that incident, Hope Exiner d’Amore suffered being pinned down and raped by Weinstein in a different hotel. In 2004, Ashley Matthau had Weinstein “[masturbate] while straddling her” on a bed after being promised a job in one of his upcoming productions. Matthau was approached by Weinstein a few days later who begged her to stay silent and offered her a bribe. In 2010, two women, Dominique Huett and Mimi Haleyi, came forward on the same day about having “oral sex…forcibly performed on [them]” (Gabler).\n\nMeryl, you have worked on major films with this man, such as *The Iron Lady* and *August: Osage County*, but somehow had no idea that he was sexually abusing your other coworkers (Ali). In fact, you were said to have “happily worked for [Harvey Weinstein]” by Rose McGowan (Ali). These accounts of sexual harassment were happening before, during, and after you worked with Weinstein. Other stars much smaller than yourself have been making jokes about Weinstein and his revolting habits for years. On the television show 30 Rock, one of the characters brags about “[turning] down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions” while her friend warns her that “you can’t stop [Weinstein],” alluding to his harassment and immense power in the business (Fey). At the 2013 Oscars, Seth MacFarlane congratulated the nominees on “no longer [having] to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein” while the audience uncomfortably chuckled (“85th Academy Awards”). Obviously, the Hollywood community knew about Weinstein. The question is: how did you not know about Weinstein?\n\nUnfortunately, Weinstein is not the only sexual predator you have worked with in the past. You worked on the movie *Manhattan* with Woody Allen in 1979. Throughout Allen’s career, it has always been rumored that he was a pedophile. Rumors became factual when his stepdaughter Dylan Farrow detailed Allen sexually abusing her as a child in an open letter (how ironic). Farrow recalls being raped in her attic, being touched in “weird” ways, naked cuddling, and many other inappropriate instances (Farrow). In continuation, you worked with Kevin Spacey on the movie *Heartburn* in 1979. Around this time, Spacey drunkenly forced himself on fourteen-year-old Anthony Rapp at an after-party for a movie premiere. More recently, eight of Spacey’s colleagues from the show *House of Cards* have detailed him as “predatory,” mentioning “nonconsensual touching and crude comments…targeted [at] staffers who were typically young and male.” One assistant described a time when Spacey “put his hands down [the assistant’s] pants” while driving a car. Spacey continued being aggressive and sexual until the assistant vocalized how uncomfortable he was (Melas). Though seeing that you didn’t speak out against these men, it seems as if you weren’t aware of their offenses either.\n\nNow, Meryl, you are known for using your voice. You often promote equality, women’s rights, and vocalize your disgust with President Trump. You use your voice and platform for good, which you should. But why have you not spoken out about all of these sexual predators? Why have you not revealed the disease of sexual harassment in your industry before? From your actions and status in Hollywood, it shows that may have known about the sexual abuse going on. Now, you may not have known about these assaults. Since you are an open feminist and activist for women’s rights, it would make sense that you would fight against these pigs if you did have knowledge of their crimes at the time. Maybe you did find out about these men at the same time the rest of the world did. Maybe these assaults were well-kept between abuser and victim for all of those years.\n\nSome say those who ignore the problem are the problem. In this case, you are a part of the problem if you had previous knowledge of these abuses. If all stars ignored the sexual harassment issue and never shared their stories, predators would have unbelievable control over Hollywood (even more than they do now). These victims need stars like you to rally for them, speak out against predators, and end harassment in your workplace. You need to do more than compliment victims for speaking out in one comment on the Weinstein scandal. You need to stand behind and fight for each victim who bravely shares their story. Your time to speak out is now, after you’ve been enlightened about the assaults, and know both sides of the story. Now is the time where you can help the victims take down their abusers once and for all. Without the help of stars, sexual harassment will continue to fester and corrode Hollywood. Therefore, it is all up to you, Meryl. Do you want to be a part of the problem or the solution? Do you want to start a movement, or do you want to stay removed from the situation?\n\nSincerely,\n\nSamantha Spence, a concerned fan\n\n## Works Cited\n\nAli, Yashar. “Exclusive: Meryl Streep Responds To Rose McGowan's Criticism.” The Huffington Post, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 19 Dec. 2017, www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meryl-streep-responds-to-rose-mcgowan-criticism_us_5a38365be4b0c65287aba6f2.\n\nAli, Yashar. “EXCLUSIVE: Meryl Streep Speaks Out Against Harvey Weinstein.” HuffPost, HuffPost News, 9 Oct. 2017, www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meryl-streep-harvey-weinstein_us_59db5d87e4b072637c45420e.\n\n“85th Academy Awards.” Mischer, Don, director.

Aristocrats had the most power and ruled over the common people. In this hierarchy men were seen as superior to women. Young girls were governed by their fathers and matured to be governed by their husbands. Shakespeare problematized this hierarchy by prominently displaying it in his plays. In Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, and Hamlet, Shakespeare presents strong female characters who challenge the social dogma of their societies and prove women are far more capable of thinking for themselves than their male counterparts believed.\n\nThis aristocratic hierarchy and sexism existed in London long before Shakespeare's arrival in the late 1580s (Radical Shakespeare 2). Though young boys in Tudor England were taught to be “active citizens” and were encouraged to speak often about taxes, laws, and foreign affairs, girls were expected to stay home and focus on more menial tasks. (RS 10). The “quiet submissiveness of women, as natural inferiors of men, to husbands and male heads of the household” (RS 12) was the customary norm. The silence of women aided to the male dominated society. Not only were women governed by men in their home lives, but they also had to adhere to rules and standards set by men in their communities. Doctor Chris Fitter states that the “National Government was dependent not just on county administration but on parish self-government, which operated through regular rotation of a large number of local offices among a community’s menfolk” (RS 10-11). The idea of men being superior to women continued to exist throughout William Shakespeare’s life and for many years after.  \n\nThe historical context that surrounds Romeo and Juliet is essential to understand when examining its plot and presentation of female characters. Even though the play takes place in Italy in the city of Verona, the events are reminiscent of those taking place in London, England at the time. It is clear that this was a conscious choice made by Shakespeare in order to problematize the events taking place in his own city of London. Embedded in this play are the issues of “London between 1594-96—the escalating inter-class youth violence, the dearth of 1594-97, and the sensational London riots of 1595” (RS 145). While these events mostly pertain to issues of class structure, they display how women were oppressed. Women were underrepresented in issues of class behavior. The riots and other forms of violence taking place at this time can be described as between “apprentices and gentlemen” (RS 146). One notable riot that occurred during this time happened “on June 12, 1595 when in response to soaring food prices, a group of apprentices at Billingsgate compelled the sale of fish at the correct price, established by the Lord Mayor” (RS 148).\n\nFood riots such as this one were not an unusual occurrence. Another riot happened just a few days later by another group of apprentices in Southwark over the price of butter: “[They] forced the sale of butter at 3d a pound rather than the 5d that the butter women were demanding” (RS 148). Even though the “butter rioters” did not commit any crime, they were “whipped, pilloried, and imprisoned” (RS 148). While these events definitely affected women they lived in fear of receiving harsh punishment for speaking out and expressing their opinions.\n\nJuliet demonstrates a sense of imprisonment which was a reality for women in London during this time period. She is constrained by her environment and by her parents. One of the most prominent examples of this is how most of her scenes take place inside of her own home.  In contrast to this, Romeo is often seen roaming the streets with his friends. Juliet only leaves the house in two instances. The first is in act four, scene one when she goes to speak to Friar Lawrence. In order to leave the house, Juliet tells her Nurse she is going to confess her sins and ask for forgiveness. In reality, she is going to ask for advice. This act shows how Juliet’s parents impose imprisonment on her. She needs their permission to leave. The second time Juliet leaves her house is when she is placed in her family’s tomb after she is believed to be dead.\n\nJuliet’s imprisonment can also be seen in how her parents control who she can and cannot associate with. The other characters of the play seem to exist outside of Juliet’s world and only enter with the permission of her parents. Her father chose who was invited to the feast at the Capulet estate. Even though Capulet says “But Montague is bound as well as I,/In penalty alike, and ‘tis not hard, I think,/For men so old as we to keep the peace” (1.2.1-4) the Montagues weren’t invited because he did not want Juliet associating with them. He agrees to be cordial with them but Romeo is definitely not the man Capulet sees his daughter marrying. In this way Juliet’s parents manipulate her surroundings and choose who she interacts with.\n\nAnother significant aspect of Juliet’s relationship with her father is that it demonstrates how women were seen as less than men in society. Not only does he dictate who she associates with, but he also decides who she will marry. Capulet intends to use Juliet as a bargaining chip. He wants her to marry Paris so their family will be in good standing with the prince. Capulet, Paris, and Lady Capulet make arrangements for the wedding without Juliet’s knowledge. It is inconceivable to Capulet that Juliet would ever think to disobey him. He tells Paris, “I will make a desperate tender/Of my child’s love. I think she will be ruled/In all aspects by me” (3.5.13-15).  At this point in time it was unheard of for a child to disobey their parents. When she expresses to her father that she does not want to marry Paris Capulet says, “Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!/ I tell thee what: get thee to church o’Thursday,/Or never after look me in the face” (3.5.165-168). Not only were women seen as lower in status when compared to men but children were seen as lower in status when compared to their parents. Children were responsible for most of the daily chores and even the children of wealthy families often went to work as servants (Isaac). For Juliet who is not only a child but also a woman to disobey her father would place shame upon her family. This hierarchy is also displayed through Juliet’s stage directions. She often kneels when speaking to her father. She says, “Good father I beseech you on my knees,/Hear me with patience but to speak a word” (3.5.164-165). This physically shows that Juliet and her father are not on the same level. She is desperate for her father to listen to her. Later in the play, Juliet kneels again to ask for her father’s forgiveness. She says, “Pardon, I beseech you./Henceforward I am ever ruled by you” (4.2.23-24). When Juliet recognizes her father’s place of power and apologizes for speaking out, Shakespeare problematizes this aspect of society. He shows that Juliet should not be at fault for wanting to govern her own life.\n\nDespite all of this, Shakespeare presents Juliet as a woman who is respectful of her superiors but also has her own opinions and is capable of making her own decisions. When she is first presented with the idea of marrying Paris she tells her mother, “It is an honor that I dream not of” (1.3.71). She speaks with dignity and grace. Even though her parents treat her as a child, Juliet shows she is quite mature through her language. She also questions Romeo’s love for her and says, “Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say ‘Ay.’/And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swear’st/Thou mayst prove false” (2.2. 95-97). She questions him because she wants to make sure his love is pure. She knows there is still a possibility that he is lying about his intentions. This shows how even though Juliet is young, she is capable of thinking rationally. Her relationship with Romeo is seen as the ultimate act of defiance. This shows how she is capable of making her own decisions. Juliet also makes the decision to commit suicide. She says, “O, happy dagger,/This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die” (5.3.174-175).  This is the one aspect of her life she is able to control. These examples show how she is desperate to break away from the constraints her parents have put in place. Therefore, she challenges the ideals of her time period.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare also presents independent female characters in the play The Merchant of Venice. Through Portia he again proves that women are intelligent individuals. Like Juliet, Portia represents imprisonment. The different scenes of the play take place either in Venice or at Portia’s estate of Belmont. When describing the estate Bassanio states, “For the four winds blow in from every coast” (1.1.175). This articulates that Belmont is surrounded by water. It is an island that exists as separate from the business affairs and crowding of the city. Belmont is quite difficult to get to. This explains why Portia’s suitors are wealthy and why Bassanio has to borrow money from Antonio in order to make it there. Portia is only able to associate with people who are wealthy enough and willing to make the journey to Belmont. She only interacts with her lady in waiting Nerissa, her potential suitors, and later in the play friends of her husband Bassanio. In this way, Portia is imprisoned by her environment.  \n\nSimilar to Juliet, Portia is governed by her father and he dictates who she associates with. Even though he is deceased, it is expressed in his will that Portia may only marry the man who chooses correctly between the three chests made of gold, silver, or lead. She is expected to honor his request. Portia recognizes she is trapped and states, “I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who/I dislike” (1.2.23-24). Her marriage is arranged based on the results of a game. She has no control over who is able to make the journey to Belmont and be a potential suitor. Once a suitor successfully chooses the correct chest, Portia is forced to succumb to the traditional practices of her time period. However, she is very aware that patriarchy is not favorable towards women. After she is betrothed to Bassanio she relinquishes her role as “lord” to him. She states, “This house, these servants, and this same myself/ Are yours, my lord’s” (3.2.174-175). Even though she has successfully taken care of her house and her servants she is forced to give these things up. She says, “I give them with this ring” (3.2.175). This moment is significant because not only is she giving up her possessions, but she is giving up herself to be ruled by a man. Through her language she demonstrates she is aware of the shift in power that is about to take place. This proves she is an intelligent women capable of thinking for herself.\n\nAlthough Portia is imprisoned, Shakespeare presents her as a powerful and independent woman. Portia challenges the constraints of her time is by disguising herself as a man. She does so in order to save her husband’s beloved friend Antonio. At this time sexist laws prevented women from having a professional presence. Portia conceives of the plan herself and tells Nerissa, “I have work in hand/ That you know yet not of. We’ll see our husbands/Before they think of us” (3.4.59-61). This shows that Portia is clever and capable of solving problems. She goes on to successfully convince a courtroom full of men that she is a well educated lawyer. She enters the room with confidence saying, “Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,/Yet in such rule that the Venetian law/Cannot impugn you as you do proceed” (4.1.180-182). Immediately she establishes herself as a person of high intelligence. As the scene progresses, it seems as if Shylock will get the pound of flesh from Antonio that he desires. Portia is quick to intervene and makes the distinction, “This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood” (4.1.319).  By doing this, she saves Antonio’s life. She accomplishes what Bassanio nor any other man was able to do.  In this instance William Shakespeare’s presentation of Portia shows that women are far more intelligent than men of his time believed.\n\nHamlet is another play in which Shakespeare presents a woman who is very intelligent and aware of the ways she is unfairly treated. Much like Juliet and Portia, Ophelia represents a woman who is abused by the males in her life. Not only is she abused by her father, but she is also abused by her brother, and Hamlet. In act one scene three Ophelia is having a conversation with her brother, Laertes. He makes the argument that there is no way Hamlet can marry her because he has to make decisions based on the country rather than his own personal feelings. Laertes tells her, “The chariest maid is prodigal enough/If she unmask her beauty to the moon” (1.3.40-41). He says that all women are promiscuous and even the purest maidens will eventually undress and become immoral. Ophelia does not accept this sexist idea. She tells her brother it is unfair of him to think this way because he does not practice what he preaches. She states, “the primrose path of dalliance treads/And recks not his own trade” (1.3.54-55). Ophelia knows that her brother does not think very highly of women. She dismisses his foolish thoughts. In this instance Shakespeare shows Ophelia as a woman who challenges a man and is not afraid to speak her mind.\n\nOphelia’s relationship with her father is also one of great complication. Just moments after Ophelia is abused by Laertes, her father steps in to voice his opinions about her relations with Hamlet. Polonius says, “I do know,/When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul/Lends the tongue vows” (1.3.124-126). The argument Polonius makes is that feelings change and young men will say anything in order to get what they want. He does not want Ophelia to believe that Hamlet loves her. Polonius orders his daughter: “I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth/Have you so slander any moment leisure/As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet” (1.3.141-143). Ophelia does not contradict her father. She says “I shall obey my lord” (1.4.145).  Ophelia is governed by her father and is expected to do as he says. She is more willing to listen to her father than she is her brother. This shows the patriarchal order of her society.\n\n Hamlet also emotionally abuses Ophelia. He manipulates her emotions. When Ophelia expresses the love he made her feel Hamlet replies, “You should not have believed me, for virtue/cannot so (inoculate) our old stock but we shall/relish of it. I loved you not” (3.1.127-129). He denies that he ever loved her. Hamlet then orders Ophelia to go to a nunnery (3.1.131). Ophelia thought Hamlet was the one man in her life who would treat her with respect and love. When this idea proves to be false, it is as if her world falls apart. Despite this, Ophelia remains respectful when talking to Hamlet. She states, “O, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!” (3.1.163). In this instance she is wise and able to think rationally about the situation. Another way Ophelia shows respect is that she continues to refer to Hamlet as “my lord” (3.1.142) throughout the conversation. This is the same way she refers to her father and demonstrates the dynamics of the male dominated society she lives in.  \n\nJust like Juliet, the only aspect of her life Ophelia can control is when she dies. She commits suicide by drowning herself. The queen makes up an elaborate story about how Ophelia was sitting on a branch and fell in the water. She was then weighed down by her clothes and drowned (4.7.190-208). The queen uses explicit detail in order to make it seem as if Ophelia’s death was an accident. She describes Ophelia, “As one incapable of her own distress/Or like a creature native and endued/Unto that element” (4.7.203-205). The queen knows what it is like to be a woman in a male dominated society. She fabricates this story so Ophelia can have a proper burial. By committing suicide, Ophelia makes the choice to die. She makes a choice with an enormous consequence. In this way Shakespeare shows Ophelia as a powerful woman.\n\n*Juliet, Portia, and Ophelia, are independent characters that Shakespeare uses in order to problematize the sexist ideas of his time period.* They all make very large decisions and prove that women have a place in a male dominated society. These characters are essential to the plots of these plays and make the idea of smart, independent women a feasible aspect of the time period.  \n\n## Works Cited\n\nFitter, Chris.

Aristocrats had the most power and ruled over the common people. In this hierarchy men were seen as superior to women. Young girls were governed by their fathers and matured to be governed by their husbands. Shakespeare problematized this hierarchy by prominently displaying it in his plays. In Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, and Hamlet, Shakespeare presents strong female characters who challenge the social dogma of their societies and prove women are far more capable of thinking for themselves than their male counterparts believed.\n\nThis aristocratic hierarchy and sexism existed in London long before Shakespeare's arrival in the late 1580s (Radical Shakespeare 2). Though young boys in Tudor England were taught to be “active citizens” and were encouraged to speak often about taxes, laws, and foreign affairs, girls were expected to stay home and focus on more menial tasks. (RS 10). The “quiet submissiveness of women, as natural inferiors of men, to husbands and male heads of the household” (RS 12) was the customary norm. The silence of women aided to the male dominated society. Not only were women governed by men in their home lives, but they also had to adhere to rules and standards set by men in their communities. Doctor Chris Fitter states that the “National Government was dependent not just on county administration but on parish self-government, which operated through regular rotation of a large number of local offices among a community’s menfolk” (RS 10-11). The idea of men being superior to women continued to exist throughout William Shakespeare’s life and for many years after.  \n\nThe historical context that surrounds Romeo and Juliet is essential to understand when examining its plot and presentation of female characters. Even though the play takes place in Italy in the city of Verona, the events are reminiscent of those taking place in London, England at the time. It is clear that this was a conscious choice made by Shakespeare in order to problematize the events taking place in his own city of London. Embedded in this play are the issues of “London between 1594-96—the escalating inter-class youth violence, the dearth of 1594-97, and the sensational London riots of 1595” (RS 145). While these events mostly pertain to issues of class structure, they display how women were oppressed. Women were underrepresented in issues of class behavior. The riots and other forms of violence taking place at this time can be described as between “apprentices and gentlemen” (RS 146). One notable riot that occurred during this time happened “on June 12, 1595 when in response to soaring food prices, a group of apprentices at Billingsgate compelled the sale of fish at the correct price, established by the Lord Mayor” (RS 148).\n\nFood riots such as this one were not an unusual occurrence. Another riot happened just a few days later by another group of apprentices in Southwark over the price of butter: “[They] forced the sale of butter at 3d a pound rather than the 5d that the butter women were demanding” (RS 148). Even though the “butter rioters” did not commit any crime, they were “whipped, pilloried, and imprisoned” (RS 148). While these events definitely affected women they lived in fear of receiving harsh punishment for speaking out and expressing their opinions.\n\nJuliet demonstrates a sense of imprisonment which was a reality for women in London during this time period. She is constrained by her environment and by her parents. One of the most prominent examples of this is how most of her scenes take place inside of her own home.  In contrast to this, Romeo is often seen roaming the streets with his friends. Juliet only leaves the house in two instances. The first is in act four, scene one when she goes to speak to Friar Lawrence. In order to leave the house, Juliet tells her Nurse she is going to confess her sins and ask for forgiveness. In reality, she is going to ask for advice. This act shows how Juliet’s parents impose imprisonment on her. She needs their permission to leave. The second time Juliet leaves her house is when she is placed in her family’s tomb after she is believed to be dead.\n\nJuliet’s imprisonment can also be seen in how her parents control who she can and cannot associate with. The other characters of the play seem to exist outside of Juliet’s world and only enter with the permission of her parents. Her father chose who was invited to the feast at the Capulet estate. Even though Capulet says “But Montague is bound as well as I,/In penalty alike, and ‘tis not hard, I think,/For men so old as we to keep the peace” (1.2.1-4) the Montagues weren’t invited because he did not want Juliet associating with them. He agrees to be cordial with them but Romeo is definitely not the man Capulet sees his daughter marrying. In this way Juliet’s parents manipulate her surroundings and choose who she interacts with.\n\nAnother significant aspect of Juliet’s relationship with her father is that it demonstrates how women were seen as less than men in society. Not only does he dictate who she associates with, but he also decides who she will marry. Capulet intends to use Juliet as a bargaining chip.

I think she will be ruled/In all aspects by me” (3.5.13-15).  At this point in time it was unheard of for a child to disobey their parents. When she expresses to her father that she does not want to marry Paris Capulet says, “Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!/ I tell thee what: get thee to church o’Thursday,/Or never after look me in the face” (3.5.165-168). Not only were women seen as lower in status when compared to men but children were seen as lower in status when compared to their parents.

For Juliet who is not only a child but also a woman to disobey her father would place shame upon her family. This hierarchy is also displayed through Juliet’s stage directions.

Young girls were governed by their fathers and matured to be governed by their husbands. Shakespeare problematized this hierarchy by prominently displaying it in his plays. In Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, and Hamlet, Shakespeare presents strong female characters who challenge the social dogma of their societies and prove women are far more capable of thinking for themselves than their male counterparts believed.</p>\n<p>This aristocratic hierarchy and sexism existed in London long before Shakespeare’s arrival in the late 1580s (Radical Shakespeare 2). Though young boys in Tudor England were taught to be “active citizens” and were encouraged to speak often about taxes, laws, and foreign affairs, girls were expected to stay home and focus on more menial tasks. (RS 10). The “quiet submissiveness of women, as natural inferiors of men, to husbands and male heads of the household” (RS 12) was the customary norm. The silence of women aided to the male dominated society. Not only were women governed by men in their home lives, but they also had to adhere to rules and standards set by men in their communities. Doctor Chris Fitter states that the “National Government was dependent not just on county administration but on parish self-government, which operated through regular rotation of a large number of local offices among a community’s menfolk” (RS 10-11). The idea of men being superior to women continued to exist throughout William Shakespeare’s life and for many years after.  </p>\n<p>The historical context that surrounds Romeo and Juliet is essential to understand when examining its plot and presentation of female characters. Even though the play takes place in Italy in the city of Verona, the events are reminiscent of those taking place in London, England at the time. It is clear that this was a conscious choice made by Shakespeare in order to problematize the events taking place in his own city of London. Embedded in this play are the issues of “London between 1594-96—the escalating inter-class youth violence, the dearth of 1594-97, and the sensational London riots of 1595” (RS 145). While these events mostly pertain to issues of class structure, they display how women were oppressed. Women were underrepresented in issues of class behavior. The riots and other forms of violence taking place at this time can be described as between “apprentices and gentlemen” (RS 146). One notable riot that occurred during this time happened “on June 12, 1595 when in response to soaring food prices, a group of apprentices at Billingsgate compelled the sale of fish at the correct price, established by the Lord Mayor” (RS 148).</p>\n<p>Food riots such as this one were not an unusual occurrence. Another riot happened just a few days later by another group of apprentices in Southwark over the price of butter: “[They] forced the sale of butter at 3d a pound rather than the 5d that the butter women were demanding” (RS 148). Even though the “butter rioters” did not commit any crime, they were “whipped, pilloried, and imprisoned” (RS 148). While these events definitely affected women they lived in fear of receiving harsh punishment for speaking out and expressing their opinions.</p>\n<p>Juliet demonstrates a sense of imprisonment which was a reality for women in London during this time period. She is constrained by her environment and by her parents. One of the most prominent examples of this is how most of her scenes take place inside of her own home.  In contrast to this, Romeo is often seen roaming the streets with his friends. Juliet only leaves the house in two instances. The first is in act four, scene one when she goes to speak to Friar Lawrence. In order to leave the house, Juliet tells her Nurse she is going to confess her sins and ask for forgiveness. In reality, she is going to ask for advice. This act shows how Juliet’s parents impose imprisonment on her. She needs their permission to leave. The second time Juliet leaves her house is when she is placed in her family’s tomb after she is believed to be dead.</p>\n<p>Juliet’s imprisonment can also be seen in how her parents control who she can and cannot associate with. The other characters of the play seem to exist outside of Juliet’s world and only enter with the permission of her parents. Her father chose who was invited to the feast at the Capulet estate. Even though Capulet says “But Montague is bound as well as I,/In penalty alike, and ‘tis not hard, I think,/For men so old as we to keep the peace” (1.2.1-4) the Montagues weren’t invited because he did not want Juliet associating with them. He agrees to be cordial with them but Romeo is definitely not the man Capulet sees his daughter marrying. In this way Juliet’s parents manipulate her surroundings and choose who she interacts with.</p>\n<p>Another significant aspect of Juliet’s relationship with her father is that it demonstrates how women were seen as less than men in society. Not only does he dictate who she associates with, but he also decides who she will marry. Capulet intends to use Juliet as a bargaining chip. He wants her to marry Paris so their family will be in good standing with the prince. Capulet, Paris, and Lady Capulet make arrangements for the wedding without Juliet’s knowledge. It is inconceivable to Capulet that Juliet would ever think to disobey him. He tells Paris, “I will make a desperate tender/Of my child’s love. I think she will be ruled/In all aspects by me” (3.5.13-15).  At this point in time it was unheard of for a child to disobey their parents. When she expresses to her father that she does not want to marry Paris Capulet says, “Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!/ I tell thee what: get thee to church o’Thursday,/Or never after look me in the face” (3.5.165-168). Not only were women seen as lower in status when compared to men but children were seen as lower in status when compared to their parents. Children were responsible for most of the daily chores and even the children of wealthy families often went to work as servants (Isaac). For Juliet who is not only a child but also a woman to disobey her father would place shame upon her family. This hierarchy is also displayed through Juliet’s stage directions. She often kneels when speaking to her father. She says, “Good father I beseech you on my knees,/Hear me with patience but to speak a word” (3.5.164-165). This physically shows that Juliet and her father are not on the same level. She is desperate for her father to listen to her. Later in the play, Juliet kneels again to ask for her father’s forgiveness. She says, “Pardon, I beseech you./Henceforward I am ever ruled by you” (4.2.23-24). When Juliet recognizes her father’s place of power and apologizes for speaking out, Shakespeare problematizes this aspect of society. He shows that Juliet should not be at fault for wanting to govern her own life.</p>\n<p>Despite all of this, Shakespeare presents Juliet as a woman who is respectful of her superiors but also has her own opinions and is capable of making her own decisions. When she is first presented with the idea of marrying Paris she tells her mother, “It is an honor that I dream not of” (1.3.71). She speaks with dignity and grace. Even though her parents treat her as a child, Juliet shows she is quite mature through her language. She also questions Romeo’s love for her and says, “Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say ‘Ay.’/And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swear’st/Thou mayst prove false” (2.2. 95-97). She questions him because she wants to make sure his love is pure. She knows there is still a possibility that he is lying about his intentions. This shows how even though Juliet is young, she is capable of thinking rationally. Her relationship with Romeo is seen as the ultimate act of defiance. This shows how she is capable of making her own decisions. Juliet also makes the decision to commit suicide. She says, “O, happy dagger,/This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die” (5.3.174-175).  This is the one aspect of her life she is able to control. These examples show how she is desperate to break away from the constraints her parents have put in place. Therefore, she challenges the ideals of her time period.</p>\n<p>William Shakespeare also presents independent female characters in the play The Merchant of Venice. Through Portia he again proves that women are intelligent individuals. Like Juliet, Portia represents imprisonment. The different scenes of the play take place either in Venice or at Portia’s estate of Belmont. When describing the estate Bassanio states, “For the four winds blow in from every coast” (1.1.175). This articulates that Belmont is surrounded by water. It is an island that exists as separate from the business affairs and crowding of the city. Belmont is quite difficult to get to. This explains why Portia’s suitors are wealthy and why Bassanio has to borrow money from Antonio in order to make it there. Portia is only able to associate with people who are wealthy enough and willing to make the journey to Belmont. She only interacts with her lady in waiting Nerissa, her potential suitors, and later in the play friends of her husband Bassanio. In this way, Portia is imprisoned by her environment.  </p>\n<p>Similar to Juliet, Portia is governed by her father and he dictates who she associates with. Even though he is deceased, it is expressed in his will that Portia may only marry the man who chooses correctly between the three chests made of gold, silver, or lead. She is expected to honor his request. Portia recognizes she is trapped and states, “I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who/I dislike” (1.2.23-24). Her marriage is arranged based on the results of a game. She has no control over who is able to make the journey to Belmont and be a potential suitor. Once a suitor successfully chooses the correct chest, Portia is forced to succumb to the traditional practices of her time period. However, she is very aware that patriarchy is not favorable towards women. After she is betrothed to Bassanio she relinquishes her role as “lord” to him. She states, “This house, these servants, and this same myself/ Are yours, my lord’s” (3.2.174-175). Even though she has successfully taken care of her house and her servants she is forced to give these things up. She says, “I give them with this ring” (3.2.175). This moment is significant because not only is she giving up her possessions, but she is giving up herself to be ruled by a man. Through her language she demonstrates she is aware of the shift in power that is about to take place. This proves she is an intelligent women capable of thinking for herself.</p>\n<p>Although Portia is imprisoned, Shakespeare presents her as a powerful and independent woman. Portia challenges the constraints of her time is by disguising herself as a man. She does so in order to save her husband’s beloved friend Antonio. At this time sexist laws prevented women from having a professional presence. Portia conceives of the plan herself and tells Nerissa, “I have work in hand/ That you know yet not of. We’ll see our husbands/Before they think of us” (3.4.59-61). This shows that Portia is clever and capable of solving problems. She goes on to successfully convince a courtroom full of men that she is a well educated lawyer. She enters the room with confidence saying, “Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,/Yet in such rule that the Venetian law/Cannot impugn you as you do proceed” (4.1.180-182). Immediately she establishes herself as a person of high intelligence. As the scene progresses, it seems as if Shylock will get the pound of flesh from Antonio that he desires. Portia is quick to intervene and makes the distinction, “This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood” (4.1.319).  By doing this, she saves Antonio’s life. She accomplishes what Bassanio nor any other man was able to do.  In this instance William Shakespeare’s presentation of Portia shows that women are far more intelligent than men of his time believed.</p>\n<p>Hamlet is another play in which Shakespeare presents a woman who is very intelligent and aware of the ways she is unfairly treated. Much like Juliet and Portia, Ophelia represents a woman who is abused by the males in her life. Not only is she abused by her father, but she is also abused by her brother, and Hamlet. In act one scene three Ophelia is having a conversation with her brother, Laertes. He makes the argument that there is no way Hamlet can marry her because he has to make decisions based on the country rather than his own personal feelings. Laertes tells her, “The chariest maid is prodigal enough/If she unmask her beauty to the moon” (1.3.40-41). He says that all women are promiscuous and even the purest maidens will eventually undress and become immoral. Ophelia does not accept this sexist idea. She tells her brother it is unfair of him to think this way because he does not practice what he preaches. She states, “the primrose path of dalliance treads/And recks not his own trade” (1.3.54-55). Ophelia knows that her brother does not think very highly of women. She dismisses his foolish thoughts. In this instance Shakespeare shows Ophelia as a woman who challenges a man and is not afraid to speak her mind.</p>\n<p>Ophelia’s relationship with her father is also one of great complication. Just moments after Ophelia is abused by Laertes, her father steps in to voice his opinions about her relations with Hamlet. Polonius says, “I do know,/When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul/Lends the tongue vows” (1.3.124-126). The argument Polonius makes is that feelings change and young men will say anything in order to get what they want. He does not want Ophelia to believe that Hamlet loves her. Polonius orders his daughter: “I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth/Have you so slander any moment leisure/As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet” (1.3.141-143). Ophelia does not contradict her father. She says “I shall obey my lord” (1.4.145).  Ophelia is governed by her father and is expected to do as he says. She is more willing to listen to her father than she is her brother. This shows the patriarchal order of her society.</p>\n<p> Hamlet also emotionally abuses Ophelia. He manipulates her emotions. When Ophelia expresses the love he made her feel Hamlet replies, “You should not have believed me, for virtue/cannot so (inoculate) our old stock but we shall/relish of it. I loved you not” (3.1.127-129). He denies that he ever loved her. Hamlet then orders Ophelia to go to a nunnery (3.1.131). Ophelia thought Hamlet was the one man in her life who would treat her with respect and love. When this idea proves to be false, it is as if her world falls apart. Despite this, Ophelia remains respectful when talking to Hamlet. She states, “O, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!” (3.1.163). In this instance she is wise and able to think rationally about the situation. Another way Ophelia shows respect is that she continues to refer to Hamlet as “my lord” (3.1.142) throughout the conversation. This is the same way she refers to her father and demonstrates the dynamics of the male dominated society she lives in.  </p>\n<p>Just like Juliet, the only aspect of her life Ophelia can control is when she dies. She commits suicide by drowning herself. The queen makes up an elaborate story about how Ophelia was sitting on a branch and fell in the water. She was then weighed down by her clothes and drowned (4.7.190-208). The queen uses explicit detail in order to make it seem as if Ophelia’s death was an accident. She describes Ophelia, “As one incapable of her own distress/Or like a creature native and endued/Unto that element” (4.7.203-205). The queen knows what it is like to be a woman in a male dominated society. She fabricates this story so Ophelia can have a proper burial. By committing suicide, Ophelia makes the choice to die. She makes a choice with an enormous consequence. In this way Shakespeare shows Ophelia as a powerful woman.</p>\n<p><em>Juliet, Portia, and Ophelia, are independent characters that Shakespeare uses in order to problematize the sexist ideas of his time period.</em> They all make very large decisions and prove that women have a place in a male dominated society. These characters are essential to the plots of these plays and make the idea of smart, independent women a feasible aspect of the time period.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"Works-Cited\"><a href=\"#Works-Cited\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Works Cited\"></a>Works Cited</h2><p>Fitter, Chris.

Another way Ophelia shows respect is that she continues to refer to Hamlet as “my lord” (3.1.142) throughout the conversation. This is the same way she refers to her father and demonstrates the dynamics of the male dominated society she lives in.  </p>\n<p>Just like Juliet, the only aspect of her life Ophelia can control is when she dies. She commits suicide by drowning herself. The queen makes up an elaborate story about how Ophelia was sitting on a branch and fell in the water. She was then weighed down by her clothes and drowned (4.7.190-208). The queen uses explicit detail in order to make it seem as if Ophelia’s death was an accident. She describes Ophelia, “As one incapable of her own distress/Or like a creature native and endued/Unto that element” (4.7.203-205). The queen knows what it is like to be a woman in a male dominated society. She fabricates this story so Ophelia can have a proper burial. By committing suicide, Ophelia makes the choice to die. She makes a choice with an enormous consequence. In this way Shakespeare shows Ophelia as a powerful woman.</p>\n<p><em>Juliet, Portia, and Ophelia, are independent characters that Shakespeare uses in order to problematize the sexist ideas of his time period.</em> They all make very large decisions and prove that women have a place in a male dominated society. These characters are essential to the plots of these plays and make the idea of smart, independent women a feasible aspect of the time period.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"Works-Cited\"><a href=\"#Works-Cited\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Works Cited\"></a>Works Cited</h2><p>Fitter, Chris.

He promptly ignored the raising of bets and jingling of coins at the card table where he sat. He knew he won, so why pretend? The three other people at the table were bluffing like stubborn children who told their mothers that they were going to run away. And he could read each one of them. The large, hairy man, Marcus, fiddled with his silver wedding ring and stared at the gold in the center of the table instead of his cards. A common tell. Tessa was the muscular woman that sat next to Sturgeon. She was a fantastic liar, but unfortunately her \"guard\" dog wasn't. Whenever she was dealt a good hand, Barkus wagged his tail. During bad hands, like this one, he growled quietly enough that only Sturgeon could hear. And Nog, the shorter fourth player? Well, he's Nog. Nobody was worse at poker than him.\n\n\"Screw it,\" Nog shouted, shoving his coin purse into the pot. \"I'm all in!\"\n\nTessa eyed everyone else. She slid her coin stacks forward. \"I'm in, too,\" she said. \"You scared, Marcus?\"\n\n\"No,\" Marcus replied. Then he flicked his wedding ring into the center. \"My momma ain't raise no quitter. Sturgeon?\"\n\n\"Your mother was a wise woman,\" Sturgeon said. He propped his bony elbows on the minuscule free space that wasn't covered in coins. Out of the twenty hands dealt he only lost one, and that was because he was more focused on his mystery meat stew than the game. He gestured to his hoard. \"Winner takes everything.\"\n\nOne by one everyone revealed their cards. Marcus placed his cards on the table. He had a measly pair. Tessa threw her cards next to his and shouted. Four of a kind. Nog scratched his head. He put his cards down along with his head. A straight flush.\n\nTessa stopped. Her smile faded. \"What?\"\n\nNog shook his head. \"I lost, yeah?\"\n\n\"Nog, that beats her hand,\" Marcus finally said.\n\n\"Oh! Then in your beautiful face, Tessa!\"\n\n\"What a shame,\" Sturgeon whispered and rubbed his hairy chin. \"This isn't good.\"\n\n\"Can't beat that, eh? I get it.\" Nog reached his hand over to Sturgeon's pile.\n\nHe slapped Nog's baby-hands away with his own cards. A royal flush. \"Now that's how you bluff, you amateurs! He ha hu hi ho!\"\n\n\"That's not fair,\" Marcus grumbled. \"You're a wizard.\"\n\n\"It isn't magic, just skill. Though, I have plenty of both. Oh, don't be like that, Marc.\" Sturgeon tossed the wedding ring back at him. \"That probably wouldn't be worth much anyway.\"\n\nTessa waved her hand, dismissively. \"Yeah, yeah. Skill? Pssh. I gotta go anyway. C'mon, Barkus.\"\n\nThe table dispersed, and over the course of an hour or so Sturgeon counted all of his winnings. He raked the gold into his pillowcase, singing \"clickity-clack, get in my sack.\" After hefting the bulging sack over his shoulder and putting on his conical hat, he journeyed out of the tavern's warm hearth into the cool darkness of night. Rain in the city never came in droplets like normal country rain, rather it coalesced into a singular sheet of water that covered everything in a liquid blanket. Lampposts dimly lit the cobblestone path to The Dragon's Den, the inn the wizard lived in. Underneath one of them sat a crying child. Sturgeon sped his pace as he passed him.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said a weak voice behind him.\n\n\"Ah, dammit,\" Sturgeon muttered under his breath. He walked backwards to the small, muddy child. \"I don't have any money for you, kid.\"\n\nWith big, teary eyes, the child said, \"I'm lost. Can you help me?\"\n\nThe wizard knelt down. \"You have any parents? Well-paid parents?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. My papa is the blacksmith for the army.\"\n\n\"Then of course I can help!\" He stood up straight and extended his hand. \"Let's go.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\" The child grabbed his hand.\n\n\"Now, where do you li—\" The child shanked him in the side.\n\nIn a matter of milliseconds, the pillowcase switched owners. The child stared down at Sturgeon, who placed his hands over the bloody part of his formerly blue robe.\n\nThe kid snickered. \"You should learn when someone's lying, mister. You'll live longer.\" Then he signed, sealed, and delivered a swift, sandal-clad kick to the wound before sprinting into an alleyway. Lightning bolts of pain spread from Sturgeon's side to all over his body.\n\n\"That little shiiii-ah ow ow ow,\" Sturgeon said to himself as he stood up. \"And here I thought I could pay off my wizard college student loans with that. Ow!\" The tip of the knife snapped in his skin. He slowly squeezed the metal out into his palm. It was a terrible shiv, meaning that the punk's father probably wasn't a freaking blacksmith. Sturgeon felt his blood turn into magma and the rain sizzle on his skin. Metaphorically, of course. He didn't get that far during his short time at Pinball W. University. Transmutation is a graduate-level skill.\n\nFortunately (or unfortunately, it really depends how you see it), this wasn't the first time he had been stabbed. The first time was in a buffet where he got into a scuffle with a bigger woman regarding the ownership of the last three crab legs. He took a vial of red liquid out of his pouch. He removed the cork with his teeth and chugged the contents. It tasted like burnt cherry pie and dandruff, but it mended the hole in his side. His flesh slowly weaved together and the pain subsided. Sturgeon looked at the shard in his hand. While he did not know how to cast flying spells or call down godly meteors from above, he did know how to locate things via magic. He ran to a book shop's yellow and blue striped awning, shutting his eyes and concentrating really, really hard on the knife tip. In the bottom of the murky lake that was his mind, he saw a faint glow in the vague shape of a knife bobbing up and down about twelve— now thirteen blocks east. As he opened his eyes, he saw an old man standing in the book shop's doorway. The owner had a worried look on his face.\n\n\"What?\" Sturgeon asked.\n\n\"I'm just making sure you're not having a stroke,\" the old man said.\n\n\"Thanks? Did you see where a kid with a large bag of money ran off to?\"\n\n\"You mean the kid that stabbed you?\"\n\n\"You saw that? Why didn't you help me?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I figured you'd be fine. And you were, before you started having a stroke.\"\n\n\"Shove off, old man.\" He snapped his fingers, hoping to set his hair ablaze. However through a mental mispronunciation, he instead filled the owner's pockets with frogs. Magical language is tricky that way.\n\nSturgeon followed the knife of light that remained in his head, his soaked boots sloshing in the rain sleeked roads. The city always had a dirt-brown tone to it. The kind of brown that almost made you want to throw up just to add more color to the city. The water didn't help its lack of appeal. He reached Salamander Street, a straightaway whose middle just barely touched outside the city square (which was actually a circle). He avoided traveling on that street. Sturgeon hated going on tangents. At the end of the way, the kid sat eating a steaming turkey leg under a scaffolding. But where was the money?\n\n\"Hey!\" Sturgeon shouted. Like a battery, he charged at the child. The kid dropped his turkey leg onto a wooden plate, jolted up, started to run away, then turned heel and retrieved the leg. Sturgeon picked up the boy by the shirt collar, causing the boy to drop the leg anyway. Before anything could happen involving a stabbing instrument, he rummaged through the kid's pockets and found the shiv. He tossed it between two dumpsters.\n\n\"Where's my money, gutter rat?\"\n\nThe ornery child spat in his face. \"Up your robe, you twingle.\"\n\nSturgeon recoiled. He's never been called a twingle before. \"You have ten seconds to tell me or you're in a world of pain.\"\n\n\"Let me go or I'll...\"\n\n\"You'll what? Stab me?\"\n\nThe kid bit his hand. Sturgeon felt eight, unbrushed mouth-bones sink into his frail palm. Instinctively, he launched his hand into the small child's eye. The little one fell down on his back, taking a few scraps of skin in between his teeth. Sturgeon place his hand on the kid's shoulder.\n\n\"Sorry about the punch. But I want my money back. No, no don't start crying. Oh, stop it.\" It was too late. Tears once again flowed from the boy's eyes like a broken faucet.\n\n\"Nog... has... your... stupid money,\" he said in between sobs.\n\n\"What!?\"\n\n\"Wot's goin' on 'ere?\"\n\nA guardswoman approached the two. She glanced down at a poor youth's swelling eyelid and the grown man with a bloodied hand.\n\n \"You're comin' with me, sir.\"\n\nSturgeon stumbled to a full stand. The kid scrambled away from Salamander Street, half-crying and half-cackling. The wizard said, \"Ah, dammit. M'am, I was merely trying to get my money.\"\n\n\"From a 'ittle boy?\"\n\n\"Yes! You see, he mugged me and took a large sack of money.\"\n\n\"Roight. Sir, this would be easier if you'd just come with me.\"\n\n\"I'm not going back in the cage!\" He snapped his fingers. Nothing happened. \"Uh...\"\n\nFive hundred feet above the scene, a crow merrily flew through the black velvet of night. She was thinking crow thoughts: food, flying, mortgages. Generally, she was having a good crow night. The last thing she thought to see was a small jewelry box spawn from the void and plummet right in front of her flight path.\n\n\"Are you done, sir?\"\n\n\"Shhh!\" He was still snapping. \"Sorry, this usually doesn't happen.\"\n\n\"Alroight, that's enough.\" She stomped over to the wizard. Then, a brown container sent from the heavens shattered upon her helmeted head. Dozens of copper rings and pearl necklaces bounced along the flagstones. She collapsed.\n\nWith wide eyes and mouth agape, Sturgeon pressed his ear to her chest. Air was still passing through her lungs. He dragged her under the scaffolding where he found the dust covered turkey drumstick. He picked up the leg, gave it sniff, and shut his eyes. What are the odds, the wizard thought. Just as Sturgeon was able to track the shiv, the shimmering scraps of turkey shown through the gray curtain of the psyche. It moved away until it stopped at the vague area of the docks, and it ran away. That is where Nog lived. With a sigh, Sturgeon shuffled to the harbor.\n\nThe rain stopped its relentless assault on the city, as Sturgeon crept through the stacks of crates and barrels. Salty sea air greeted his nose along with the pleasant aroma of dead fish.  Behind the stacked cargo stood Nog, hugging the white pillowcase atop a barrel near the water. No kids in sight. In fact, the only sounds he could hear was the crashing of waves and the creaking of ships. No one else was there. He calculated the proper angle needed to hit Nog. With a smile, he chucked the half eaten turkey leg. It hit the barrel next to him.\n\n\"Dammit!\"\n\n\"Come out, Wizard,\" Nog said to nobody. \"The urchin told me you were visiting!\"\n\n\"No thanks! Just give me my money back! Why are you even doing this, Nog?\"\n\n\"Why be good at poker when I can just mug the people who are? C'mon! We can have a better discussion face to face.\"\n\n\"I'm good!\"\n\n\"Tell you what! We play one more game! Winner takes all!\"\n\nSturgeon stepped into view and walked toward Nog. \"Okay. What's the game? Blackjack?\"\n\n\"Dodgebolt!\" He pulled out a crossbow from behind the barrel.\n\nA bolt struck through the wizard's hat. Another one flew through the air, whizzing by his ear. Sturgeon dove behind a row of boxes. Nog skidded around the corner. He squeezed the trigger. The bolt stuck into the wood next to the wizard. Sturgeon swallowed. He shut his eyes and rapidly snapped.\n\nBehind his eyelids, he heard a scream. He opened them and saw where Nog once stood now danced a large ball of fire. His gold still sat on the barrel. The wizard did a pathetic sprint past the mobile fireplace to the pillowcase. Sturgeon embraced the cold sack much like someone reuniting with a missing loved one, squeezing excess water out of the sides. Suddenly, a hot mass rammed into his back. Sturgeon's world spun then got very salty and blurry. And progressively darker. Nog's cooked body floated next to him, but it rose up. Or rather Sturgeon was sinking. He looked at the gold in his arms. *In the two and a half decades of his life, he never thought that money would be the death of him.* He just imagined his demise would be because of a random bear attack or a misplaced stick of lit dynamite.\n\n\"Blrah, blammib,\" he said as bubbles spewed out of his mouth. He loosened each finger and let the bag of loot sink down the depths. He swam up (rather well, in fact, for a man with no muscle mass) through the ocean's surface, scrambling up a nearby ladder. He peered down the water, measuring the approximate location of his gold. He reached out a hand, and breathed a lungful of salty air.\n\n\"I will see you again, my love.\"\n\nFatigue stuck his body, and he dragged his feet back toward his home. On his way down the rain-slicked roads, two guardsmen and the one guardswoman from before surrounded him.\n\n“This the guy,” one of the guardsmen asked.\n\n“Oh yeah. That’s him alroight,” the guardswoman said, rubbing her head with one hand and holding a broken jewelry box with the other.\n\n“Woah woah!” Sturgeon raised his hands next to his head. “I didn’t do nothing!”\n\n“We have received at least two reports saying that you punched a child and assaulted an officer. Is that nothing, sir?”\n\n“Listen, I can explain,” Sturgeon said with a dry mouth.\n\n“Yeah, yeah. ‘Cuff him.”\n\nOld, iron shackles clapped around his wrists. With a swift hoist, the guardsman lifted Sturgeon, and he was carried toward the local dungeon. And he never saw the gold ever again.\n\n## About the Author ##\n\nI grew up in a little town called Pennsauken which is a stone’s throw away from Camden. I intend on becoming a fiction writer, however, life would most likely turn me into a guidance counselor or something else that isn't part of the plan. To describe me in three words, I would consider myself as hilarious, skilled, and gorgeous, but others–”realists” is what they like to call themselves–would describe me as delusional, arrogant, and a 5/10 at best. This is my second time my work has been published, but the first time I submitted a fiction piece.\n","source":"foolsgold.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Fool's Gold\nauthor: Albert Moncao\nlayout: article\nheaderimage: img/header-foolsgold.jpg\naccentext: “In two and a half decades of his life, he never thought that money would be the death of him.”\naccentimage: img/accent-image-foolsgold.jpg\n---\nSturgeon Winthdrop leaned back on his wooden chair and listened to the droplets of rain splash on the tavern's roof.

I intend on becoming a fiction writer, however, life would most likely turn me into a guidance counselor or something else that isn't part of the plan. To describe me in three words, I would consider myself as hilarious, skilled, and gorgeous, but others–”realists” is what they like to call themselves–would describe me as delusional, arrogant, and a 5/10 at best. This is my second time my work has been published, but the first time I submitted a fiction piece.\n","date":"2018-04-19T20:50:55.000Z","updated":"2018-04-19T20:50:55.000Z","path":"foolsgold.html","_id":"cjg6zcfc10004ikrcurln5co2","comments":1,"content":"<p>Sturgeon Winthdrop leaned back on his wooden chair and listened to the droplets of rain splash on the tavern’s roof. He promptly ignored the raising of bets and jingling of coins at the card table where he sat. He knew he won, so why pretend? The three other people at the table were bluffing like stubborn children who told their mothers that they were going to run away. And he could read each one of them. The large, hairy man, Marcus, fiddled with his silver wedding ring and stared at the gold in the center of the table instead of his cards. A common tell. Tessa was the muscular woman that sat next to Sturgeon. She was a fantastic liar, but unfortunately her “guard” dog wasn’t. Whenever she was dealt a good hand, Barkus wagged his tail. During bad hands, like this one, he growled quietly enough that only Sturgeon could hear. And Nog, the shorter fourth player? Well, he’s Nog. Nobody was worse at poker than him.</p>\n<p>“Screw it,” Nog shouted, shoving his coin purse into the pot. “I’m all in!”</p>\n<p>Tessa eyed everyone else. She slid her coin stacks forward. “I’m in, too,” she said. “You scared, Marcus?”</p>\n<p>“No,” Marcus replied. Then he flicked his wedding ring into the center. “My momma ain’t raise no quitter. Sturgeon?”</p>\n<p>“Your mother was a wise woman,” Sturgeon said. He propped his bony elbows on the minuscule free space that wasn’t covered in coins. Out of the twenty hands dealt he only lost one, and that was because he was more focused on his mystery meat stew than the game. He gestured to his hoard. “Winner takes everything.”</p>\n<p>One by one everyone revealed their cards. Marcus placed his cards on the table. He had a measly pair. Tessa threw her cards next to his and shouted. Four of a kind. Nog scratched his head. He put his cards down along with his head. A straight flush.</p>\n<p>Tessa stopped. Her smile faded. “What?”</p>\n<p>Nog shook his head. “I lost, yeah?”</p>\n<p>“Nog, that beats her hand,” Marcus finally said.</p>\n<p>“Oh! Then in your beautiful face, Tessa!”</p>\n<p>“What a shame,” Sturgeon whispered and rubbed his hairy chin. “This isn’t good.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t beat that, eh? I get it.” Nog reached his hand over to Sturgeon’s pile.</p>\n<p>He slapped Nog’s baby-hands away with his own cards. A royal flush. “Now that’s how you bluff, you amateurs! He ha hu hi ho!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not fair,” Marcus grumbled. “You’re a wizard.”</p>\n<p>“It isn’t magic, just skill. Though, I have plenty of both. Oh, don’t be like that, Marc.” Sturgeon tossed the wedding ring back at him. “That probably wouldn’t be worth much anyway.”</p>\n<p>Tessa waved her hand, dismissively. “Yeah, yeah. Skill? Pssh. I gotta go anyway. C’mon, Barkus.”</p>\n<p>The table dispersed, and over the course of an hour or so Sturgeon counted all of his winnings. He raked the gold into his pillowcase, singing “clickity-clack, get in my sack.” After hefting the bulging sack over his shoulder and putting on his conical hat, he journeyed out of the tavern’s warm hearth into the cool darkness of night. Rain in the city never came in droplets like normal country rain, rather it coalesced into a singular sheet of water that covered everything in a liquid blanket. Lampposts dimly lit the cobblestone path to The Dragon’s Den, the inn the wizard lived in. Underneath one of them sat a crying child. Sturgeon sped his pace as he passed him.</p>\n<p>“Excuse me, sir,” said a weak voice behind him.</p>\n<p>“Ah, dammit,” Sturgeon muttered under his breath. He walked backwards to the small, muddy child. “I don’t have any money for you, kid.”</p>\n<p>With big, teary eyes, the child said, “I’m lost. Can you help me?”</p>\n<p>The wizard knelt down. “You have any parents? Well-paid parents?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir. My papa is the blacksmith for the army.”</p>\n<p>“Then of course I can help!” He stood up straight and extended his hand. “Let’s go.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you, sir.” The child grabbed his hand.</p>\n<p>“Now, where do you li—“ The child shanked him in the side.</p>\n<p>In a matter of milliseconds, the pillowcase switched owners. The child stared down at Sturgeon, who placed his hands over the bloody part of his formerly blue robe.</p>\n<p>The kid snickered. “You should learn when someone’s lying, mister. You’ll live longer.” Then he signed, sealed, and delivered a swift, sandal-clad kick to the wound before sprinting into an alleyway. Lightning bolts of pain spread from Sturgeon’s side to all over his body.</p>\n<p>“That little shiiii-ah ow ow ow,” Sturgeon said to himself as he stood up. “And here I thought I could pay off my wizard college student loans with that. Ow!” The tip of the knife snapped in his skin. He slowly squeezed the metal out into his palm. It was a terrible shiv, meaning that the punk’s father probably wasn’t a freaking blacksmith. Sturgeon felt his blood turn into magma and the rain sizzle on his skin. Metaphorically, of course. He didn’t get that far during his short time at Pinball W. University. Transmutation is a graduate-level skill.</p>\n<p>Fortunately (or unfortunately, it really depends how you see it), this wasn’t the first time he had been stabbed. The first time was in a buffet where he got into a scuffle with a bigger woman regarding the ownership of the last three crab legs. He took a vial of red liquid out of his pouch. He removed the cork with his teeth and chugged the contents. It tasted like burnt cherry pie and dandruff, but it mended the hole in his side. His flesh slowly weaved together and the pain subsided. Sturgeon looked at the shard in his hand. While he did not know how to cast flying spells or call down godly meteors from above, he did know how to locate things via magic. He ran to a book shop’s yellow and blue striped awning, shutting his eyes and concentrating really, really hard on the knife tip. In the bottom of the murky lake that was his mind, he saw a faint glow in the vague shape of a knife bobbing up and down about twelve— now thirteen blocks east. As he opened his eyes, he saw an old man standing in the book shop’s doorway. The owner had a worried look on his face.</p>\n<p>“What?” Sturgeon asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m just making sure you’re not having a stroke,” the old man said.</p>\n<p>“Thanks? Did you see where a kid with a large bag of money ran off to?”</p>\n<p>“You mean the kid that stabbed you?”</p>\n<p>“You saw that? Why didn’t you help me?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I figured you’d be fine. And you were, before you started having a stroke.”</p>\n<p>“Shove off, old man.” He snapped his fingers, hoping to set his hair ablaze. However through a mental mispronunciation, he instead filled the owner’s pockets with frogs. Magical language is tricky that way.</p>\n<p>Sturgeon followed the knife of light that remained in his head, his soaked boots sloshing in the rain sleeked roads. The city always had a dirt-brown tone to it. The kind of brown that almost made you want to throw up just to add more color to the city. The water didn’t help its lack of appeal. He reached Salamander Street, a straightaway whose middle just barely touched outside the city square (which was actually a circle). He avoided traveling on that street. Sturgeon hated going on tangents. At the end of the way, the kid sat eating a steaming turkey leg under a scaffolding. But where was the money?</p>\n<p>“Hey!” Sturgeon shouted. Like a battery, he charged at the child. The kid dropped his turkey leg onto a wooden plate, jolted up, started to run away, then turned heel and retrieved the leg. Sturgeon picked up the boy by the shirt collar, causing the boy to drop the leg anyway. Before anything could happen involving a stabbing instrument, he rummaged through the kid’s pockets and found the shiv. He tossed it between two dumpsters.</p>\n<p>“Where’s my money, gutter rat?”</p>\n<p>The ornery child spat in his face. “Up your robe, you twingle.”</p>\n<p>Sturgeon recoiled. He’s never been called a twingle before. “You have ten seconds to tell me or you’re in a world of pain.”</p>\n<p>“Let me go or I’ll…”</p>\n<p>“You’ll what? Stab me?”</p>\n<p>The kid bit his hand. Sturgeon felt eight, unbrushed mouth-bones sink into his frail palm. Instinctively, he launched his hand into the small child’s eye. The little one fell down on his back, taking a few scraps of skin in between his teeth. Sturgeon place his hand on the kid’s shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Sorry about the punch. But I want my money back. No, no don’t start crying. Oh, stop it.” It was too late. Tears once again flowed from the boy’s eyes like a broken faucet.</p>\n<p>“Nog… has… your… stupid money,” he said in between sobs.</p>\n<p>“What!?”</p>\n<p>“Wot’s goin’ on ‘ere?”</p>\n<p>A guardswoman approached the two. She glanced down at a poor youth’s swelling eyelid and the grown man with a bloodied hand.</p>\n<p> “You’re comin’ with me, sir.”</p>\n<p>Sturgeon stumbled to a full stand. The kid scrambled away from Salamander Street, half-crying and half-cackling. The wizard said, “Ah, dammit. M’am, I was merely trying to get my money.”</p>\n<p>“From a ‘ittle boy?”</p>\n<p>“Yes! You see, he mugged me and took a large sack of money.”</p>\n<p>“Roight. Sir, this would be easier if you’d just come with me.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going back in the cage!” He snapped his fingers. Nothing happened. “Uh…”</p>\n<p>Five hundred feet above the scene, a crow merrily flew through the black velvet of night. She was thinking crow thoughts: food, flying, mortgages. Generally, she was having a good crow night. The last thing she thought to see was a small jewelry box spawn from the void and plummet right in front of her flight path.</p>\n<p>“Are you done, sir?”</p>\n<p>“Shhh!” He was still snapping. “Sorry, this usually doesn’t happen.”</p>\n<p>“Alroight, that’s enough.” She stomped over to the wizard. Then, a brown container sent from the heavens shattered upon her helmeted head. Dozens of copper rings and pearl necklaces bounced along the flagstones. She collapsed.</p>\n<p>With wide eyes and mouth agape, Sturgeon pressed his ear to her chest. Air was still passing through her lungs. He dragged her under the scaffolding where he found the dust covered turkey drumstick. He picked up the leg, gave it sniff, and shut his eyes. What are the odds, the wizard thought. Just as Sturgeon was able to track the shiv, the shimmering scraps of turkey shown through the gray curtain of the psyche. It moved away until it stopped at the vague area of the docks, and it ran away. That is where Nog lived. With a sigh, Sturgeon shuffled to the harbor.</p>\n<p>The rain stopped its relentless assault on the city, as Sturgeon crept through the stacks of crates and barrels. Salty sea air greeted his nose along with the pleasant aroma of dead fish.  Behind the stacked cargo stood Nog, hugging the white pillowcase atop a barrel near the water. No kids in sight. In fact, the only sounds he could hear was the crashing of waves and the creaking of ships. No one else was there. He calculated the proper angle needed to hit Nog. With a smile, he chucked the half eaten turkey leg. It hit the barrel next to him.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!”</p>\n<p>“Come out, Wizard,” Nog said to nobody. “The urchin told me you were visiting!”</p>\n<p>“No thanks! Just give me my money back! Why are you even doing this, Nog?”</p>\n<p>“Why be good at poker when I can just mug the people who are? C’mon! We can have a better discussion face to face.”</p>\n<p>“I’m good!”</p>\n<p>“Tell you what! We play one more game! Winner takes all!”</p>\n<p>Sturgeon stepped into view and walked toward Nog. “Okay. What’s the game? Blackjack?”</p>\n<p>“Dodgebolt!” He pulled out a crossbow from behind the barrel.</p>\n<p>A bolt struck through the wizard’s hat. Another one flew through the air, whizzing by his ear. Sturgeon dove behind a row of boxes. Nog skidded around the corner. He squeezed the trigger. The bolt stuck into the wood next to the wizard. Sturgeon swallowed. He shut his eyes and rapidly snapped.</p>\n<p>Behind his eyelids, he heard a scream. He opened them and saw where Nog once stood now danced a large ball of fire. His gold still sat on the barrel. The wizard did a pathetic sprint past the mobile fireplace to the pillowcase. Sturgeon embraced the cold sack much like someone reuniting with a missing loved one, squeezing excess water out of the sides. Suddenly, a hot mass rammed into his back. Sturgeon’s world spun then got very salty and blurry. And progressively darker. Nog’s cooked body floated next to him, but it rose up. Or rather Sturgeon was sinking.

Sturgeon embraced the cold sack much like someone reuniting with a missing loved one, squeezing excess water out of the sides. Suddenly, a hot mass rammed into his back. Sturgeon’s world spun then got very salty and blurry. And progressively darker. Nog’s cooked body floated next to him, but it rose up. Or rather Sturgeon was sinking. He looked at the gold in his arms. <em>In the two and a half decades of his life, he never thought that money would be the death of him.</em> He just imagined his demise would be because of a random bear attack or a misplaced stick of lit dynamite.</p>\n<p>“Blrah, blammib,” he said as bubbles spewed out of his mouth. He loosened each finger and let the bag of loot sink down the depths. He swam up (rather well, in fact, for a man with no muscle mass) through the ocean’s surface, scrambling up a nearby ladder. He peered down the water, measuring the approximate location of his gold. He reached out a hand, and breathed a lungful of salty air.</p>\n<p>“I will see you again, my love.”</p>\n<p>Fatigue stuck his body, and he dragged his feet back toward his home. On his way down the rain-slicked roads, two guardsmen and the one guardswoman from before surrounded him.</p>\n<p>“This the guy,” one of the guardsmen asked.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah. That’s him alroight,” the guardswoman said, rubbing her head with one hand and holding a broken jewelry box with the other.</p>\n<p>“Woah woah!” Sturgeon raised his hands next to his head. “I didn’t do nothing!”</p>\n<p>“We have received at least two reports saying that you punched a child and assaulted an officer. Is that nothing, sir?”</p>\n<p>“Listen, I can explain,” Sturgeon said with a dry mouth.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah. ‘Cuff him.”</p>\n<p>Old, iron shackles clapped around his wrists. With a swift hoist, the guardsman lifted Sturgeon, and he was carried toward the local dungeon.

This dark *dramatis personae* now reaches across a wide swath of drama and literature, from the chaotic spectacle on Elizabethan playhouses, to epic poetry depicting mankind’s original sin, and the final novel of one of America’s greatest writers. Consider Satan in Milton’s *Paradise Lost*, or the dashing and beautifully dressed young boy who appears from hell to sow chaos in a medieval Austrian village in Mark Twain’s *The Mysterious Stranger*. These antiheroes have stood the test of time by personifying a genre of seductive evil that is far more recognizable to both modern and Renaissance-era audiences than the old foretelling of fire and brimstone in scripture. Unlike the gruesome ensembles found brushed into medieval diptychs—animalistic abominations with curled horns, gaped jaws, and spoiling flesh—a devil like Mephistopheles, traipsing across the stage in the meager robes of a monk, offers a mirror image of ourselves. It is often with the help of such an affable disguise that an author may present a more complicated and nuanced embodiment of absolute evil, one with a personality, one with thoughts and desires, one capable experiencing the emotions we all share—one that presents far greater danger than the ghoulish stains on a cathedral window. As a demonic figure, Mephistopheles is drawn to damnation like a shark to the scent of blood; he eagerly exploits mankind’s inherent flaws, provides the tools for their inevitable self-destruction, and empowers them to ruin. By closely examining this kind of dramatic devil and the role ascribed to him, we can better understand what has made him a sympathetic character to audiences for centuries and peer inside a young artist’s struggle to make sense of the darkness within us all.\n\nBy 1590, Cambridge-educated Christopher Marlowe developed a body of work brilliantly positioned to reflect the mood of London’s burgeoning cultural industry at the forefront of its journey from medieval to Renaissance thought. The plays he wrote to that point were colored with provocative ideas and iconoclastic subjects that tiptoed right to the threshold of what was deemed acceptable in Elizabethan England. His work was meant to challenge social boundaries and often purposefully sought to make audiences of the time uncomfortable with irreverent stories of regicide and mockery of religious figures. It is in this brand of spectacle that Marlowe wrote his fourth play, *The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus*, which tells the story of “a consummate scholar’s embrace of necromancy to gain a ‘world of profit and delight’” by selling his soul to the devil (Gainor et al. 672). *Doctor Faustus* itself is an English take on the earlier German adaptation of the Faust legend. At the beginning of the play’s five-act structure, a chorus introduces the eponymous Doctor Faustus, a brilliant scientist and physician born “base of stock” in Wittenberg, Germany, who strives for a higher understanding of the universe and the god-like powers this would entail. We are led to appreciate in the prologue that Faustus’ fate will mirror that of Icarus, a Greek mythological figure whose flight too near to the sun melted his waxen wings and sent him tumbling from the sky to his death. Ultimately *Doctor Faustus* is a cautionary tale of tragic overreach in the pursuit of knowledge, asking us to consider how much knowledge is too much and if there is something intrinsically damnable for men who seek to attain such power. This is a key theme that rears its head in stories of Faustian bargains, of prideful souls led astray by sympathetic devils.\n\nIn the first scene, Faustus enters his study and launches into a lamenting, arrogant soliloquy on how he has mastered every academic subject under the sun. He claims that logic and law are trivial and beneath him, questions the purpose of medicine unless it can raise the dead, and declares divinity pointless as all humans are guilty of sin, adding dismissively, “What doctrine call you this? *Que sera, sera*, / ‘What will be, shall be?’ Divinity, *adieu*!” (Marlowe 1.1.49-50). He turns to a book of necromancy and claims that if he were to master this art “All things that move between the quiet poles / Shall be at my command” (1.1.58-59). Two angels then appear—Good and Evil, respectively—and argue with him to either lay that “damned book” aside or continue on his quest to harness black magic. This exchange between these “shoulder angels” is the first in a series of warnings to Faustus (and the audience) that he is embarking upon a terrible mistake, although he could scarcely be bothered to listen. Like a child eagerly reciting a Christmas list, he begins to announce all the wonderful things he can do once he summons spirits to his side, boasting that he will dispatch them across the world in search of “princely delicates” and drive occupying Spanish armies from northern Europe, among other promised feats. The audience will very well recognize the risk in following this path, but for Faustus the temptation is much too strong for him to resist. We see Faustus’ flaws as a character blatantly on display from the opening scene.\nLater in Act One Faustus reads from a Latin incantation in the book of necromancy, exalting such infamous names as Lucifer, Prince of the East, Beelzebub, monarch of burning hell, and lastly conjures Mephistopheles in his natural form of a hideous devil. Faustus recoils at the sight, telling the demon “Thou art too ugly to attend on me. / Go, and return an old Franciscan friar; / That holy shape becomes a devil best” (1.3.25-27). As commanded, Mephistopheles leaves the stage and quickly returns as a monk. Putting aside Marlowe’s jape at the Catholic clergy (which was certainly meant to appeal to a Protestant English audience), the play now reveals its use of this less threatening and perhaps more flattering personification of a satanic figure—none of the explicit grotesqueries associated with the demonic, just a kindly friar draped in fraying robes. Mephistopheles’ is not a classically romantic depiction, but it is nonetheless an unassuming guise donned when one cannot possibly look the bare truth of this unvarnished evil in the face. Here we also first see how Marlowe plants a foot in two distinct interpretations of the nature of hell and damnation, a central motif that will carry on for the remainder of the play.\n\nIn Christianity, every demon counted among the pantheon of hell is in some regard a perverted version of a god from pagan religions, the story being that they sided with Lucifer in a rebellion against the Almighty and were forever cast out of heaven. Church doctrine in Marlowe’s time held that pagans who worshiped these gods were damned, and thus demons served as a reminder of what would happen to their eternal souls if they, too, strayed from the Church. Providing demons with names and personalities helped early Christians to identify with them and made their cautionary tale more relatable, giving them grotesque and frightful forms perhaps only underscored by the horrific fate awaiting the unfaithful. Yet Marlowe did not take this route; Mephistopheles, as he spends the vast majority of the play, is hardly frightful, and his simple costume on stage would have been quite familiar to the audience. He is not a stereotype but a complex character in his own right, one that is also indicative of humanism in Renaissance theater. In Mephistopheles, we have a demon that eschews all traditional depictions so that audiences may begin to identify with and find him sympathetic while he nonetheless makes it clear that he has come to reap Faustus’ soul, speaking openly of this impending damnation.\n\nAlmost immediately after his conjuring, Mephistopheles announces that he is a servant of Lucifer, to which Faustus asks, “Did he not charge thee to appear to me?” and the demon replies, “No, I came now hither of mine own accord” (1.3.44-45). This exchange is crucial to the audience’s understanding of the nature of their relationship. How are we to interpret Mephistopheles’ summons? We may think that Faustus truly commanded him to appear, or, as the following lines indicate, Mephistopheles can almost sense Faustus’ wavering faith and insatiable appetite for knowledge and power across space and time—a shark to blood. The demon then explains, “For when we hear one rack the name of God, / Abjure the Scriptures and his Savior Christ, / We fly in hope to get his glorious soul, / Nor will we come unless he use such means / Whereby he is in danger to be damned” (1.3.48-53). Faustus is in danger to be damned. Mephistopheles says this plainly and admits that this is the reason why he appeared. Faustus’ incantations are irrelevant; Mephistopheles has not come to aid Faustus on a quest to master the black arts, he has come to harvest a crop. This speaks to a reading of the play in which Faustus repeatedly fails to repent because his damnation is already sealed despite his actions. Like Mephistopheles, who is bound to serve Lucifer, it is questionable if Faustus possesses the free will to choose his fate.\n\nThis exchange now sheds further light on the play’s reformed interpretation of hell as a state of mind rather than a physical place and also reveals Mephistopheles’ view of his own damnation. Faustus in so many words asks how demons came to dwell with Lucifer, and in a striking, moving string of dialogue, Mephistopheles confesses that they are “Unhappy spirits that fell with Lucifer, / Conspired against our God with Lucifer, / And are forever damned with Lucifer” (1.3.72-74). This is one of several lines where Mephistopheles is brutally truthful with Faustus. Here we have a demon, come to reap a man’s soul, who is nothing but honest in his telling of what fate awaits Faustus; Mephistopheles has experienced this damnation as well, and he comes right to the edge of pleading with Faustus to repent, to recognize the error of his ways. This is also speaks to the nature of servitude in *Doctor Faustus*. Despite claiming to seek out damned souls and coming to Faustus “of mine own accord,” Mephistopheles is enchained to Lucifer by strict deontological ethics. He is duty bound by a categorical imperative to obey Lucifer—Mephistopheles fell from heaven with Lucifer, is forever cleaved off from God’s grace, and now, almost as punishment, is damned to serve as a thrall to Lucifer’s will; Mephistopheles’ own feelings and emotions, as we have shown he has them, can never factor into his actions. While there is room for gray in his thoughts, his service in Lucifer’s conquest to enlarge his kingdom is only ever black and white. Clearly, this aids the interpretation of Mephistopheles as a sympathetic antagonist, and dare we say an antihero. Furthermore, when it comes to the reality of hell itself, Faustus asks how it is that Mephistopheles is both “in hell” at this very moment and also standing before him in that study. To this question, Mephistopheles likewise holds nothing back, admitting, “Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it. / Think’st thou that I, who saw the face of God / And tasted the eternal joys of heaven, / Am not tormented with ten thousand hells / In being deprived of everlasting bliss? / O Faustus, leave these frivolous demands, / Which strike a terror to my fainting soul!” (1.3.78-84). In revealing to Faustus his own experience of dwelling with Lucifer, Marlowe introduces what is perhaps the central conflict churning within Mephistopheles: having experienced “the eternal joys of heaven” and yet being forever “deprived of everlasting bliss.” How could an audience not begin to sympathize with this otherwise demonic, evil figure? Mephistopheles’ characterization is multi-faceted—capable of experiencing sorrow and pain just as he is capable of inflicting it in others; he is profoundly human in this regard. Brilliantly Marlowe is able to, within just a few lines, trick his deeply religious Elizabethan audience into identifying with a character that Church doctrine says is the embodiment of all they must avoid. Moreover, Marlowe rejects the traditional Orthodox perception of hell as a physical place—a burning pit, *à la* Dante Alighieri—for a more nuanced motif. Hell, if we are to believe Mephistopheles, is a state of mind, wherever God is not, and to be forever separated from God is to be in hell, a point of Christian doctrine which would be all too familiar to an audience in Elizabethan England.\n\nAfter leaving to confer with Lucifer, Mephistopheles returns to Faustus at the beginning of Act Two and outlines the following bargain: Mephistopheles will serve at Faustus’ side for twenty-four years, enabling him the ability to use magic as he pleases. However, at the end of this term, Faustus will offer his body and soul to Lucifer and spend the rest of eternity damned in hell. To seal their pact, Faustus is made to write a contract in his own blood that stipulates, among other conditions, that “Mephistopheles shall be his servant, / and at his command” (2.1.97-98). Throughout the play’s ensuing scenes, the audience witnesses how Faustus squanders his newly bestowed powers on frivolities like chasing women and playing practical jokes on the pope. Despite all his earlier boasts on what he would achieve with this god-like omnipotence, Faustus nonetheless reverts to adolescent sideshows and detours—a demonic presence perched at his side like a vulture all the while. His actions are nothing of what we should expect from a consummate scholar who claims to have mastered every earthly subject under the sun. As twenty-four years are whittled away by the end of Act Five, Faustus can see his damnation toll the hour. Mephistopheles then arrives on stage with a host of devils to physically drag Faustus down to hell, now apparently a literal realm of fire and suffering. Faustus tries to repent, cries out for redemption—“Adders and serpents, let me breathe a while! / Ugly hell, gape not. Come not, Lucifer!” (5.2.18-19)—but there is none to be found. Faustus’ body and soul are swept away to eternal damnation, and “*The devils exeunt with him.*”\n\nAs the Chorus reenters the stage and laments Faustus’ tragic demise, warning the audience to “regard his hellish fall,” we can now see the totality of this deceitful plot laid bare. One could posit the question if Mephistopheles was truly ever Faustus’ servant, or if his every line spoken on stage was in the furtherance of Lucifer’s desire to enlarge his kingdom. For the agents of hell, what was the cost of Mephistopheles spending twenty-four years entertaining Faustus’ childish fantasies? Scarcely anything meaningful at all, and yet for their troubles Lucifer was able to reap one more arrogant, damned soul. Theirs was a lopsided bargain to say the least, to reap a man’s soul at such a fire sale price. Yet in Mephistopheles, we see a perfect vessel to execute Faustus’ damnation—a worthy agent of Lucifer—all wrapped in the unassuming guise of a kindly friar. In a way, Mephistopheles’ successfully weaponized sympathy, using this characterization to quicken Faustus’ own flaws and blind him to the much darker plot at hand. It is a tremendous confidence trick played on Faustus and the audience and belies Christopher Marlowe’s skill as a writer to stage this cautionary tale. By the end of Act Five, as a hellish spectacle storms the stage, the audience could be forgiven for thinking that some happy ending awaited Faustus, that he may yet repent for embracing in necromancy, and it is through Mephistopheles that the audience would have been deceived. All the while we would have been led to hold some shred of sympathy for the devil.\n\n## About the Author\nMatt Fulton is an English and Political Science double-major and a recent transfer to Rutgers University-Camden.

As a demonic figure, Mephistopheles is drawn to damnation like a shark to the scent of blood; he eagerly exploits mankind’s inherent flaws, provides the tools for their inevitable self-destruction, and empowers them to ruin. By closely examining this kind of dramatic devil and the role ascribed to him, we can better understand what has made him a sympathetic character to audiences for centuries and peer inside a young artist’s struggle to make sense of the darkness within us all.\n\nBy 1590, Cambridge-educated Christopher Marlowe developed a body of work brilliantly positioned to reflect the mood of London’s burgeoning cultural industry at the forefront of its journey from medieval to Renaissance thought. The plays he wrote to that point were colored with provocative ideas and iconoclastic subjects that tiptoed right to the threshold of what was deemed acceptable in Elizabethan England. His work was meant to challenge social boundaries and often purposefully sought to make audiences of the time uncomfortable with irreverent stories of regicide and mockery of religious figures. It is in this brand of spectacle that Marlowe wrote his fourth play, *The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus*, which tells the story of “a consummate scholar’s embrace of necromancy to gain a ‘world of profit and delight’” by selling his soul to the devil (Gainor et al. 672). *Doctor Faustus* itself is an English take on the earlier German adaptation of the Faust legend. At the beginning of the play’s five-act structure, a chorus introduces the eponymous Doctor Faustus, a brilliant scientist and physician born “base of stock” in Wittenberg, Germany, who strives for a higher understanding of the universe and the god-like powers this would entail. We are led to appreciate in the prologue that Faustus’ fate will mirror that of Icarus, a Greek mythological figure whose flight too near to the sun melted his waxen wings and sent him tumbling from the sky to his death. Ultimately *Doctor Faustus* is a cautionary tale of tragic overreach in the pursuit of knowledge, asking us to consider how much knowledge is too much and if there is something intrinsically damnable for men who seek to attain such power. This is a key theme that rears its head in stories of Faustian bargains, of prideful souls led astray by sympathetic devils.\n\nIn the first scene, Faustus enters his study and launches into a lamenting, arrogant soliloquy on how he has mastered every academic subject under the sun. He claims that logic and law are trivial and beneath him, questions the purpose of medicine unless it can raise the dead, and declares divinity pointless as all humans are guilty of sin, adding dismissively, “What doctrine call you this? *Que sera, sera*, / ‘What will be, shall be?’ Divinity, *adieu*!” (Marlowe 1.1.49-50). He turns to a book of necromancy and claims that if he were to master this art “All things that move between the quiet poles / Shall be at my command” (1.1.58-59). Two angels then appear—Good and Evil, respectively—and argue with him to either lay that “damned book” aside or continue on his quest to harness black magic. This exchange between these “shoulder angels” is the first in a series of warnings to Faustus (and the audience) that he is embarking upon a terrible mistake, although he could scarcely be bothered to listen. Like a child eagerly reciting a Christmas list, he begins to announce all the wonderful things he can do once he summons spirits to his side, boasting that he will dispatch them across the world in search of “princely delicates” and drive occupying Spanish armies from northern Europe, among other promised feats. The audience will very well recognize the risk in following this path, but for Faustus the temptation is much too strong for him to resist. We see Faustus’ flaws as a character blatantly on display from the opening scene.\nLater in Act One Faustus reads from a Latin incantation in the book of necromancy, exalting such infamous names as Lucifer, Prince of the East, Beelzebub, monarch of burning hell, and lastly conjures Mephistopheles in his natural form of a hideous devil. Faustus recoils at the sight, telling the demon “Thou art too ugly to attend on me. / Go, and return an old Franciscan friar; / That holy shape becomes a devil best” (1.3.25-27). As commanded, Mephistopheles leaves the stage and quickly returns as a monk. Putting aside Marlowe’s jape at the Catholic clergy (which was certainly meant to appeal to a Protestant English audience), the play now reveals its use of this less threatening and perhaps more flattering personification of a satanic figure—none of the explicit grotesqueries associated with the demonic, just a kindly friar draped in fraying robes. Mephistopheles’ is not a classically romantic depiction, but it is nonetheless an unassuming guise donned when one cannot possibly look the bare truth of this unvarnished evil in the face. Here we also first see how Marlowe plants a foot in two distinct interpretations of the nature of hell and damnation, a central motif that will carry on for the remainder of the play.\n\nIn Christianity, every demon counted among the pantheon of hell is in some regard a perverted version of a god from pagan religions, the story being that they sided with Lucifer in a rebellion against the Almighty and were forever cast out of heaven. Church doctrine in Marlowe’s time held that pagans who worshiped these gods were damned, and thus demons served as a reminder of what would happen to their eternal souls if they, too, strayed from the Church. Providing demons with names and personalities helped early Christians to identify with them and made their cautionary tale more relatable, giving them grotesque and frightful forms perhaps only underscored by the horrific fate awaiting the unfaithful. Yet Marlowe did not take this route; Mephistopheles, as he spends the vast majority of the play, is hardly frightful, and his simple costume on stage would have been quite familiar to the audience. He is not a stereotype but a complex character in his own right, one that is also indicative of humanism in Renaissance theater. In Mephistopheles, we have a demon that eschews all traditional depictions so that audiences may begin to identify with and find him sympathetic while he nonetheless makes it clear that he has come to reap Faustus’ soul, speaking openly of this impending damnation.\n\nAlmost immediately after his conjuring, Mephistopheles announces that he is a servant of Lucifer, to which Faustus asks, “Did he not charge thee to appear to me?” and the demon replies, “No, I came now hither of mine own accord” (1.3.44-45). This exchange is crucial to the audience’s understanding of the nature of their relationship. How are we to interpret Mephistopheles’ summons? We may think that Faustus truly commanded him to appear, or, as the following lines indicate, Mephistopheles can almost sense Faustus’ wavering faith and insatiable appetite for knowledge and power across space and time—a shark to blood. The demon then explains, “For when we hear one rack the name of God, / Abjure the Scriptures and his Savior Christ, / We fly in hope to get his glorious soul, / Nor will we come unless he use such means / Whereby he is in danger to be damned” (1.3.48-53). Faustus is in danger to be damned. Mephistopheles says this plainly and admits that this is the reason why he appeared. Faustus’ incantations are irrelevant; Mephistopheles has not come to aid Faustus on a quest to master the black arts, he has come to harvest a crop. This speaks to a reading of the play in which Faustus repeatedly fails to repent because his damnation is already sealed despite his actions. Like Mephistopheles, who is bound to serve Lucifer, it is questionable if Faustus possesses the free will to choose his fate.\n\nThis exchange now sheds further light on the play’s reformed interpretation of hell as a state of mind rather than a physical place and also reveals Mephistopheles’ view of his own damnation. Faustus in so many words asks how demons came to dwell with Lucifer, and in a striking, moving string of dialogue, Mephistopheles confesses that they are “Unhappy spirits that fell with Lucifer, / Conspired against our God with Lucifer, / And are forever damned with Lucifer” (1.3.72-74). This is one of several lines where Mephistopheles is brutally truthful with Faustus. Here we have a demon, come to reap a man’s soul, who is nothing but honest in his telling of what fate awaits Faustus; Mephistopheles has experienced this damnation as well, and he comes right to the edge of pleading with Faustus to repent, to recognize the error of his ways. This is also speaks to the nature of servitude in *Doctor Faustus*. Despite claiming to seek out damned souls and coming to Faustus “of mine own accord,” Mephistopheles is enchained to Lucifer by strict deontological ethics. He is duty bound by a categorical imperative to obey Lucifer—Mephistopheles fell from heaven with Lucifer, is forever cleaved off from God’s grace, and now, almost as punishment, is damned to serve as a thrall to Lucifer’s will; Mephistopheles’ own feelings and emotions, as we have shown he has them, can never factor into his actions. While there is room for gray in his thoughts, his service in Lucifer’s conquest to enlarge his kingdom is only ever black and white. Clearly, this aids the interpretation of Mephistopheles as a sympathetic antagonist, and dare we say an antihero. Furthermore, when it comes to the reality of hell itself, Faustus asks how it is that Mephistopheles is both “in hell” at this very moment and also standing before him in that study. To this question, Mephistopheles likewise holds nothing back, admitting, “Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it. / Think’st thou that I, who saw the face of God / And tasted the eternal joys of heaven, / Am not tormented with ten thousand hells / In being deprived of everlasting bliss? / O Faustus, leave these frivolous demands, / Which strike a terror to my fainting soul!” (1.3.78-84). In revealing to Faustus his own experience of dwelling with Lucifer, Marlowe introduces what is perhaps the central conflict churning within Mephistopheles: having experienced “the eternal joys of heaven” and yet being forever “deprived of everlasting bliss.” How could an audience not begin to sympathize with this otherwise demonic, evil figure? Mephistopheles’ characterization is multi-faceted—capable of experiencing sorrow and pain just as he is capable of inflicting it in others; he is profoundly human in this regard. Brilliantly Marlowe is able to, within just a few lines, trick his deeply religious Elizabethan audience into identifying with a character that Church doctrine says is the embodiment of all they must avoid. Moreover, Marlowe rejects the traditional Orthodox perception of hell as a physical place—a burning pit, *à la* Dante Alighieri—for a more nuanced motif. Hell, if we are to believe Mephistopheles, is a state of mind, wherever God is not, and to be forever separated from God is to be in hell, a point of Christian doctrine which would be all too familiar to an audience in Elizabethan England.\n\nAfter leaving to confer with Lucifer, Mephistopheles returns to Faustus at the beginning of Act Two and outlines the following bargain: Mephistopheles will serve at Faustus’ side for twenty-four years, enabling him the ability to use magic as he pleases. However, at the end of this term, Faustus will offer his body and soul to Lucifer and spend the rest of eternity damned in hell. To seal their pact, Faustus is made to write a contract in his own blood that stipulates, among other conditions, that “Mephistopheles shall be his servant, / and at his command” (2.1.97-98). Throughout the play’s ensuing scenes, the audience witnesses how Faustus squanders his newly bestowed powers on frivolities like chasing women and playing practical jokes on the pope. Despite all his earlier boasts on what he would achieve with this god-like omnipotence, Faustus nonetheless reverts to adolescent sideshows and detours—a demonic presence perched at his side like a vulture all the while. His actions are nothing of what we should expect from a consummate scholar who claims to have mastered every earthly subject under the sun. As twenty-four years are whittled away by the end of Act Five, Faustus can see his damnation toll the hour. Mephistopheles then arrives on stage with a host of devils to physically drag Faustus down to hell, now apparently a literal realm of fire and suffering. Faustus tries to repent, cries out for redemption—“Adders and serpents, let me breathe a while! / Ugly hell, gape not. Come not, Lucifer!” (5.2.18-19)—but there is none to be found. Faustus’ body and soul are swept away to eternal damnation, and “*The devils exeunt with him.*”\n\nAs the Chorus reenters the stage and laments Faustus’ tragic demise, warning the audience to “regard his hellish fall,” we can now see the totality of this deceitful plot laid bare. One could posit the question if Mephistopheles was truly ever Faustus’ servant, or if his every line spoken on stage was in the furtherance of Lucifer’s desire to enlarge his kingdom. For the agents of hell, what was the cost of Mephistopheles spending twenty-four years entertaining Faustus’ childish fantasies? Scarcely anything meaningful at all, and yet for their troubles Lucifer was able to reap one more arrogant, damned soul. Theirs was a lopsided bargain to say the least, to reap a man’s soul at such a fire sale price. Yet in Mephistopheles, we see a perfect vessel to execute Faustus’ damnation—a worthy agent of Lucifer—all wrapped in the unassuming guise of a kindly friar. In a way, Mephistopheles’ successfully weaponized sympathy, using this characterization to quicken Faustus’ own flaws and blind him to the much darker plot at hand. It is a tremendous confidence trick played on Faustus and the audience and belies Christopher Marlowe’s skill as a writer to stage this cautionary tale. By the end of Act Five, as a hellish spectacle storms the stage, the audience could be forgiven for thinking that some happy ending awaited Faustus, that he may yet repent for embracing in necromancy, and it is through Mephistopheles that the audience would have been deceived. All the while we would have been led to hold some shred of sympathy for the devil.\n\n## About the Author\nMatt Fulton is an English and Political Science double-major and a recent transfer to Rutgers University-Camden.

At the beginning of the play’s five-act structure, a chorus introduces the eponymous Doctor Faustus, a brilliant scientist and physician born “base of stock” in Wittenberg, Germany, who strives for a higher understanding of the universe and the god-like powers this would entail. We are led to appreciate in the prologue that Faustus’ fate will mirror that of Icarus, a Greek mythological figure whose flight too near to the sun melted his waxen wings and sent him tumbling from the sky to his death. Ultimately <em>Doctor Faustus</em> is a cautionary tale of tragic overreach in the pursuit of knowledge, asking us to consider how much knowledge is too much and if there is something intrinsically damnable for men who seek to attain such power. This is a key theme that rears its head in stories of Faustian bargains, of prideful souls led astray by sympathetic devils.</p>\n<p>In the first scene, Faustus enters his study and launches into a lamenting, arrogant soliloquy on how he has mastered every academic subject under the sun. He claims that logic and law are trivial and beneath him, questions the purpose of medicine unless it can raise the dead, and declares divinity pointless as all humans are guilty of sin, adding dismissively, “What doctrine call you this? <em>Que sera, sera</em>, / ‘What will be, shall be?’ Divinity, <em>adieu</em>!” (Marlowe 1.1.49-50). He turns to a book of necromancy and claims that if he were to master this art “All things that move between the quiet poles / Shall be at my command” (1.1.58-59). Two angels then appear—Good and Evil, respectively—and argue with him to either lay that “damned book” aside or continue on his quest to harness black magic. This exchange between these “shoulder angels” is the first in a series of warnings to Faustus (and the audience) that he is embarking upon a terrible mistake, although he could scarcely be bothered to listen. Like a child eagerly reciting a Christmas list, he begins to announce all the wonderful things he can do once he summons spirits to his side, boasting that he will dispatch them across the world in search of “princely delicates” and drive occupying Spanish armies from northern Europe, among other promised feats. The audience will very well recognize the risk in following this path, but for Faustus the temptation is much too strong for him to resist. We see Faustus’ flaws as a character blatantly on display from the opening scene.<br>Later in Act One Faustus reads from a Latin incantation in the book of necromancy, exalting such infamous names as Lucifer, Prince of the East, Beelzebub, monarch of burning hell, and lastly conjures Mephistopheles in his natural form of a hideous devil. Faustus recoils at the sight, telling the demon “Thou art too ugly to attend on me. / Go, and return an old Franciscan friar; / That holy shape becomes a devil best” (1.3.25-27). As commanded, Mephistopheles leaves the stage and quickly returns as a monk. Putting aside Marlowe’s jape at the Catholic clergy (which was certainly meant to appeal to a Protestant English audience), the play now reveals its use of this less threatening and perhaps more flattering personification of a satanic figure—none of the explicit grotesqueries associated with the demonic, just a kindly friar draped in fraying robes. Mephistopheles’ is not a classically romantic depiction, but it is nonetheless an unassuming guise donned when one cannot possibly look the bare truth of this unvarnished evil in the face. Here we also first see how Marlowe plants a foot in two distinct interpretations of the nature of hell and damnation, a central motif that will carry on for the remainder of the play.</p>\n<p>In Christianity, every demon counted among the pantheon of hell is in some regard a perverted version of a god from pagan religions, the story being that they sided with Lucifer in a rebellion against the Almighty and were forever cast out of heaven. Church doctrine in Marlowe’s time held that pagans who worshiped these gods were damned, and thus demons served as a reminder of what would happen to their eternal souls if they, too, strayed from the Church. Providing demons with names and personalities helped early Christians to identify with them and made their cautionary tale more relatable, giving them grotesque and frightful forms perhaps only underscored by the horrific fate awaiting the unfaithful. Yet Marlowe did not take this route; Mephistopheles, as he spends the vast majority of the play, is hardly frightful, and his simple costume on stage would have been quite familiar to the audience. He is not a stereotype but a complex character in his own right, one that is also indicative of humanism in Renaissance theater. In Mephistopheles, we have a demon that eschews all traditional depictions so that audiences may begin to identify with and find him sympathetic while he nonetheless makes it clear that he has come to reap Faustus’ soul, speaking openly of this impending damnation.</p>\n<p>Almost immediately after his conjuring, Mephistopheles announces that he is a servant of Lucifer, to which Faustus asks, “Did he not charge thee to appear to me?” and the demon replies, “No, I came now hither of mine own accord” (1.3.44-45). This exchange is crucial to the audience’s understanding of the nature of their relationship. How are we to interpret Mephistopheles’ summons? We may think that Faustus truly commanded him to appear, or, as the following lines indicate, Mephistopheles can almost sense Faustus’ wavering faith and insatiable appetite for knowledge and power across space and time—a shark to blood. The demon then explains, “For when we hear one rack the name of God, / Abjure the Scriptures and his Savior Christ, / We fly in hope to get his glorious soul, / Nor will we come unless he use such means / Whereby he is in danger to be damned” (1.3.48-53). Faustus is in danger to be damned. Mephistopheles says this plainly and admits that this is the reason why he appeared. Faustus’ incantations are irrelevant; Mephistopheles has not come to aid Faustus on a quest to master the black arts, he has come to harvest a crop. This speaks to a reading of the play in which Faustus repeatedly fails to repent because his damnation is already sealed despite his actions. Like Mephistopheles, who is bound to serve Lucifer, it is questionable if Faustus possesses the free will to choose his fate.</p>\n<p>This exchange now sheds further light on the play’s reformed interpretation of hell as a state of mind rather than a physical place and also reveals Mephistopheles’ view of his own damnation. Faustus in so many words asks how demons came to dwell with Lucifer, and in a striking, moving string of dialogue, Mephistopheles confesses that they are “Unhappy spirits that fell with Lucifer, / Conspired against our God with Lucifer, / And are forever damned with Lucifer” (1.3.72-74). This is one of several lines where Mephistopheles is brutally truthful with Faustus. Here we have a demon, come to reap a man’s soul, who is nothing but honest in his telling of what fate awaits Faustus; Mephistopheles has experienced this damnation as well, and he comes right to the edge of pleading with Faustus to repent, to recognize the error of his ways. This is also speaks to the nature of servitude in <em>Doctor Faustus</em>. Despite claiming to seek out damned souls and coming to Faustus “of mine own accord,” Mephistopheles is enchained to Lucifer by strict deontological ethics. He is duty bound by a categorical imperative to obey Lucifer—Mephistopheles fell from heaven with Lucifer, is forever cleaved off from God’s grace, and now, almost as punishment, is damned to serve as a thrall to Lucifer’s will; Mephistopheles’ own feelings and emotions, as we have shown he has them, can never factor into his actions. While there is room for gray in his thoughts, his service in Lucifer’s conquest to enlarge his kingdom is only ever black and white. Clearly, this aids the interpretation of Mephistopheles as a sympathetic antagonist, and dare we say an antihero. Furthermore, when it comes to the reality of hell itself, Faustus asks how it is that Mephistopheles is both “in hell” at this very moment and also standing before him in that study. To this question, Mephistopheles likewise holds nothing back, admitting, “Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it. / Think’st thou that I, who saw the face of God / And tasted the eternal joys of heaven, / Am not tormented with ten thousand hells / In being deprived of everlasting bliss? / O Faustus, leave these frivolous demands, / Which strike a terror to my fainting soul!” (1.3.78-84). In revealing to Faustus his own experience of dwelling with Lucifer, Marlowe introduces what is perhaps the central conflict churning within Mephistopheles: having experienced “the eternal joys of heaven” and yet being forever “deprived of everlasting bliss.” How could an audience not begin to sympathize with this otherwise demonic, evil figure? Mephistopheles’ characterization is multi-faceted—capable of experiencing sorrow and pain just as he is capable of inflicting it in others; he is profoundly human in this regard. Brilliantly Marlowe is able to, within just a few lines, trick his deeply religious Elizabethan audience into identifying with a character that Church doctrine says is the embodiment of all they must avoid. Moreover, Marlowe rejects the traditional Orthodox perception of hell as a physical place—a burning pit, <em>à la</em> Dante Alighieri—for a more nuanced motif. Hell, if we are to believe Mephistopheles, is a state of mind, wherever God is not, and to be forever separated from God is to be in hell, a point of Christian doctrine which would be all too familiar to an audience in Elizabethan England.</p>\n<p>After leaving to confer with Lucifer, Mephistopheles returns to Faustus at the beginning of Act Two and outlines the following bargain: Mephistopheles will serve at Faustus’ side for twenty-four years, enabling him the ability to use magic as he pleases. However, at the end of this term, Faustus will offer his body and soul to Lucifer and spend the rest of eternity damned in hell. To seal their pact, Faustus is made to write a contract in his own blood that stipulates, among other conditions, that “Mephistopheles shall be his servant, / and at his command” (2.1.97-98). Throughout the play’s ensuing scenes, the audience witnesses how Faustus squanders his newly bestowed powers on frivolities like chasing women and playing practical jokes on the pope. Despite all his earlier boasts on what he would achieve with this god-like omnipotence, Faustus nonetheless reverts to adolescent sideshows and detours—a demonic presence perched at his side like a vulture all the while. His actions are nothing of what we should expect from a consummate scholar who claims to have mastered every earthly subject under the sun. As twenty-four years are whittled away by the end of Act Five, Faustus can see his damnation toll the hour. Mephistopheles then arrives on stage with a host of devils to physically drag Faustus down to hell, now apparently a literal realm of fire and suffering. Faustus tries to repent, cries out for redemption—“Adders and serpents, let me breathe a while! / Ugly hell, gape not. Come not, Lucifer!” (5.2.18-19)—but there is none to be found. Faustus’ body and soul are swept away to eternal damnation, and “<em>The devils exeunt with him.</em>”</p>\n<p>As the Chorus reenters the stage and laments Faustus’ tragic demise, warning the audience to “regard his hellish fall,” we can now see the totality of this deceitful plot laid bare. One could posit the question if Mephistopheles was truly ever Faustus’ servant, or if his every line spoken on stage was in the furtherance of Lucifer’s desire to enlarge his kingdom. For the agents of hell, what was the cost of Mephistopheles spending twenty-four years entertaining Faustus’ childish fantasies? Scarcely anything meaningful at all, and yet for their troubles Lucifer was able to reap one more arrogant, damned soul. Theirs was a lopsided bargain to say the least, to reap a man’s soul at such a fire sale price. Yet in Mephistopheles, we see a perfect vessel to execute Faustus’ damnation—a worthy agent of Lucifer—all wrapped in the unassuming guise of a kindly friar. In a way, Mephistopheles’ successfully weaponized sympathy, using this characterization to quicken Faustus’ own flaws and blind him to the much darker plot at hand. It is a tremendous confidence trick played on Faustus and the audience and belies Christopher Marlowe’s skill as a writer to stage this cautionary tale. By the end of Act Five, as a hellish spectacle storms the stage, the audience could be forgiven for thinking that some happy ending awaited Faustus, that he may yet repent for embracing in necromancy, and it is through Mephistopheles that the audience would have been deceived. All the while we would have been led to hold some shred of sympathy for the devil.</p>\n<h2 id=\"About-the-Author\"><a href=\"#About-the-Author\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"About the Author\"></a>About the Author</h2><p>Matt Fulton is an English and Political Science double-major and a recent transfer to Rutgers University-Camden.

Grandma taught preschool for several decades, and she valued education so much that when it came to her grandchildren, she stepped in the drivers’ seat.</p>\n<p>“Repeat after me,” she said. <em>“¡Me empuje, abuela!”</em> (push me, grandma!) and a chorus of &gt;little voices, my brothers, cousins, and I, would repeat the phrase back, and she would &gt;push each one of us on the swings.</p>\n<p>I gained my foundation for the Spanish language at home, the way a language should be taught. Although my family is not Hispanic, the adults who raised me understood the benefits of being well-rounded. It was important to them that I developed strong communication skills, and not just in English. I learned alongside my grandmother, picking up secondhand words and phrases, colors and numbers, and I learned at school, too. In second grade, my elementary school’s world language curriculum began. Once every two weeks, our teacher put on a video, and a woman in a pink dress taught us about <em>los pajaros, osos, y caballeros.</em> We didn’t learn verbs or sentences, just nouns that second graders would like. I walked into third grade armed with my grandma’s teachings, and a big, proverbial bucket of nouns: birds, bears, and cowboys.</p>\n<p>In third grade, the learning began in earnest. I started spelling and writing out things I had only ever been able to say. I could introduce myself, tell the time, and differentiate between the days of the week. Still, Spanish class came on a rolling cart, an hour for a week, with a part-time teacher. The course never had a classroom or adequate funding, so even the students knew Spanish was an afterthought. Before long, my classmates and I felt disenchanted with the school system and the curriculum, which offered us an underwhelming educational experience. Our teachers tried their best, but they failed to engage us, and the class felt like a waste of time. I went on to high school Spanish I with a weaker vocabulary than when I was five, and little interest in improvement.</p>\n<p>However, my relationship with Spanish class changed swiftly, and to my benefit. Although it wasn’t always easy, I picked the language right back up. Throughout high school, I learned a lot of new words, mastered a lot of sentence structures, and practiced speaking, off the cuff. By graduation, I could create a sentence as I said it, as opposed to memorizing it off of a piece of paper. My conversations were no longer mechanical and robotic; they were spontaneous and interesting, purely through fluency. A testament to my growth, or maybe my senioritis, I did fifteen minutes of prep work for my final speech, and walked out with an A.</p>\n<p>When I was eighteen, I gained employment at a movie theater in South Jersey. This situation exposed me to all different types of cultures, and all different types of customers. One day a woman walked up to my box office, with a panicked expression and shaking hands. She was definitely having a veritable bad day. This lady had two small children, and she couldn’t speak English, but I explained the theater’s seating policies as best I could, in English, but she still didn’t understand. She had bought tickets online, for the wrong showing, and she didn’t know what to do. When her eyes started to water, I decided to try something I had never done before. Instead of letting this woman grow more concerned, I explained as best I could in Spanish. I warned her that I wasn’t fully fluent, and I was missing a lot of words. This was evident in my speech – I remember speaking in choppy, broken sentences.</p>\n<p>The woman cocked her head at <em>“necesitas devuelves sus boletos aqui,”</em> a grossly translated approximation of “you can refund your tickets here.” Despite this, she understood <em>“puedo darte las entradas correctas,” “no hay problema,”</em> and most importantly, <em>“gracias.”</em> “I can get you the right tickets,” I said. “It’s not a problem. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Using my knowledge of Spanish, I was able to provide a positive customer experience for someone who ordinarily would have struggled. As an employee, this benefits the company I work for, since my actions in this situation solved a problem for a customer. I think my words had a larger impact when I consider my role as a citizen and a member of a community. Someone who struggles with English deals with a language barrier every day, with every interaction they have outside of their home. I know from experience that learning a language later in life can be difficult and overwhelming. Learning a few words in a foreign language is a simple goal, and easier than it sounds. A non-fluent English speaker will never judge you for poor Spanish. They will be grateful for the effort, for meeting them halfway in the conversation, and for your patience. There is power in literacy, in fluency, and in understanding. I still speak Spanish regularly, at work and with my friends. I plan to continue working on my fluency in college and for the rest of my life. My grandmother overflows with pride at the fact that she helped teach me something so useful, and I am endlessly grateful to her for gifting me the power of words.</p>\n<h2 id=\"About-the-Author\"><a href=\"#About-the-Author\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"About the Author\"></a>About the Author</h2><p>Julia is a first year biology student at Rutgers University Camden, from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
