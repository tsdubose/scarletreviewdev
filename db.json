Series has paved the way for further appreciation of graphic novels and animated television shows.","_content":"\nIn terms of art, comic books and animated television shows are often belittled or not considered as forms of \"high art.\" High art, or high culture, is defined as a piece that permeates throughout time and sets new standards for that field. It is something that comments on the human condition and yet is aesthetically pleasing. Both graphic novels and cartoons have a rightful place in the eyes of high art, and that fact could not be more evident than in the classic fusion of the two mediums in *Batman: The Animated Series* (TAS).\n\nGiven the time that it was created in 1992, *Batman: The Animated Series* had superb animation and art design. Character models were based off of Bruce Timm's designs, which modernized Batman characters' appearances without making them dated by today's standards. The movements of the various characters were slow, yet detailed. A single frame is a work of art. Unlike the over-exaggerated actions of cartoons from that time, ![Batman Villain Clayface](img/batman1.jpg) the movements of each character are realistic. For example, during the two-part episode \"Feat of Clay,\" Batman faces the super villain Clayface. This particular episode was animated excellently, because it demonstrated Clayface's moldable, liquid-like abilities through smooth animation.\n\nFight scenes in the original animated series were not as quickly paced as those found in future cartoons like Justice League Unlimited, however ![Batman Villain Joker](img/batman2.jpg) this is not a detriment to the show. Every impact was felt and the occasions where quicker animation were used would be exciting. In \"The Demon's Quest,\" the sword fight between Ra's Al Ghul and Batman was faster, making it tense and full of energy.\n\nThe show also employed use of shadows and minimalist art for the title cards and the actual show, which is appropriate for the tone of *Batman: The Animated Series*. The use of shadows made it easier to animate, thus adding fluidity to the movements. Through silhouettes, a feeling of power and mystery was made whenever a character is shown in darkness with only a few features showing. In the episode \"The Laughing Fish,\" as The Joker staggers away Batman appears in shadow looming over Joker. It was an extremely intimidating frame; this noir motif matched the show's darker tone compared to the light-hearted comedic shows that shared its channel like Tiny Toons and Animaniacs.\n\nOne of the greatest praises *Batman: The Animated Series*  received was due to its superior voice acting. Kevin Conroy is the definitive Batman, using two different voices to portray  Batman and Bruce Wayne - the former is deep and subdued, while the latter is higher pitched and  emotive. His performance was so well received that Conroy continues to be The Dark Knight's voice to this day. Conroy's costar Mark Hamill voiced the Joker and brought a manic energy to the role. He perfectly balanced playfulness and psychopathic sadism in his voice. Unsurprisingly, Hamill was nominated in 1994 for Best Achievement for Voice Acting for his role as The Joker.\n\nThrough the sheer power of their voices, Conroy and Hamill brought life to these characters and remain inseparable from them.\n\nAspects from the show actually influenced the comic and animated world. Everyone's favorite killer jester, Harley Quinn, made her debut in *Batman: The Animated Series*. Her main purpose was to be just another henchman for the Joker, but due to her popularity she was introduced into the comic's universe. Police detective Renee Montoya had a similar situation, but the only difference was that she was ![Batman Villain Harley Quinn](img/batman3.jpg) introduced into comics right before the show's airing. As an older villain, Mr. Freeze's origin was revamped in order to match with the serious nature of the show. This change stuck for the mainstream comics due to it being high quality. The aforementioned Clayface was also visually updated in the comics to be more akin to his animated counterpart. All of these new characters and changes are still in existence in movies, comics, and more cartoons. Because this show had brought characters like Mr. Freeze and Harley Quinn into the limelight, they will always permeate through time.\n\n*Batman: The Animated Series* was the gateway for more DC comics animated shows. After the success of Batman's show, the creators started Superman: The Animated Series, which took place in the same universe. Following that was the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited ![Batman Villian Mr. Freeze](img/batman4.jpg) cartoons.  From 1992 to 2006 cartoons based on DC comics within a cohesive continuity and serious stories had been popular thanks to Batman. In other words, this show was the standard for animation and graphic novels and a foundation upon which future animated comic book shows were built for fourteen years.\n\nThe characters were the show's greatest strength. While there wasn't an overarching story, most of the episodes dealt with some kind of social issue. Mental health issues were a common theme, each of Batman's villains represented a different type: Poison Ivy symbolized the evils of fanatical activism and eco terrorism, Two-Face or Harvey Dent was a metaphor for split personality disorder, and the Joker was the personification of chaos (\"Arkham Sessions\").\n\nThe show created three-dimensional characters that many sympathize with. The aforementioned Mr. Freeze received a new origin story. Originally, Mr. Freeze was the typical mad scientist and not treated seriously. That changed, however, when Paul Dini wrote the episode \"Heart of Ice.\" The backstory for Mr. Freeze became that Doctor Victor Fries (of course pronounced \"freeze\") tried to save his wife Nora through cryogenic suspension, but his funding got shut down due to the CEO's greed which potentially could kill her. In a fit of rage, Fries pulled a gun on the CEO and he got kicked into a table full of chemicals, turning him into a vengeful man who cannot survive outside subzero temperatures. It was a tortured existence as he explained in the episode, \"To never again walk on a summer's day with the hot wind in your face and a warm hand to hold. Oh yes, I'd kill for that!\" The accident made him cold and emotionless as shown when he allowed one of his henchmen to be frozen and left behind because of his \"incompetence.\" Half of his lines are comprised of wanting for revenge and spoken in robotic monotone. On numerous occasions he claims he is emotionless, yet after he fails to exact his vengeance he cries and asks his wife for forgiveness. Sadness is an emotion.\n\nInstead of being just a man with a cool gun (pun intended), Mr. Freeze became a tragic character who had a dying wife and was constrained in a refrigerated suit. It was groundbreaking. Of course the most complex character in the entire show is the Caped Crusader himself. ![Batman Silhouetted by Lightning](img/batman5.jpg) Bruce Wayne had witnessed the death of his own parents at the age of eight and ever since that night he had dedicated his life to fighting evil. In addition to training to be an expert detective and fighter, Bruce Wayne is the head of a major company that regularly donates to charity. Batman adopted Dick Grayson, Robin, after Dick's parents are murdered much like his own parents. Every night he faces criminals and supervillains, yet he manages to maintain appearances for social events. Batman did all of this in the name of his dead parents, and that requires superhuman time management skills. The (relative) realism found within all of these characters give the viewer empathy toward the actions these people may commit, and it is up to the watcher to justify their actions if possible.\n\nOften times in *Batman: The Animated Series*, there wasn't an easy answer to the questions raised which revealed a truth: life isn't black or white but actually a series of circumstances that create the hands of fate. In the episode \"Two-Face,\" Batman defeats Harvey Dent ![Batman Villain Two-face](img/batman6.jpg) by throwing a box of silver dollars on the ground as Dent flips his own coin that determined if his hostage would die, making him mentally break down when he can't find his among the other coins. It was established early in the episode that Harvey Dent had anger issues that manifested into an alternate personality at a young age, so the question of Dent being conscious of his actions was raised. It was unclear if Dent was a bad guy. There was no revelry on Batman's side despite his victory. In fact, there was quite a bit of crying. It all ended on a sad note, making it more nuanced than that of the typical superhero cartoon.\n\nAlthough there are many points that support *Batman: The Animated Series* as a piece of high art, there is an argument to be made that it is actually low art (Plescher). ![High Art Comparison Chart ](img/batman7.jpg) \"Low art\" is often categorized as mass produced and for a wide audience. Popular culture is often seen as the same as low culture and the show is part of pop culture (\"High and Low\"). Using the transitive relation, that makes Batman low art. Granted, anything that has action figures made for it is difficult to be deemed as \"not intended for a wide audience,\" ( and I am positive that I have some Batman action figures in my basement). There is truth to that, in the fact that the wide audience intention and subsequent commercialization aspect does deafen its ability to be defined as true high art. However, it is because the aspects that made it a candidate for high art overshadow the low art characteristics, thus making it push through the boundaries between the two.\n\nBy utilizing fantastic animation and art design, this show is a visual work of art. The animated series fleshed out realistic characters, (as realistic as a living lump of clay can be,) that challenge the ideas of evil. ![Another Silhouette of Batman](img/batman8.jpg) It also broke new ground in animation and in comics by introducing new characters and concepts to the tedium. *Batman: The Animated Series* has paved the way for further appreciation of graphic novels and animated television shows.\n\n### Works Cited\nBurnett, Alan. \"Two-Face.\" *Batman: The Animated Series*. 25 Sept. 1992.

In a fit of rage, Fries pulled a gun on the CEO and he got kicked into a table full of chemicals, turning him into a vengeful man who cannot survive outside subzero temperatures. It was a tortured existence as he explained in the episode, \"To never again walk on a summer's day with the hot wind in your face and a warm hand to hold. Oh yes, I'd kill for that!\" The accident made him cold and emotionless as shown when he allowed one of his henchmen to be frozen and left behind because of his \"incompetence.\" Half of his lines are comprised of wanting for revenge and spoken in robotic monotone. On numerous occasions he claims he is emotionless, yet after he fails to exact his vengeance he cries and asks his wife for forgiveness. Sadness is an emotion.\n\nInstead of being just a man with a cool gun (pun intended), Mr. Freeze became a tragic character who had a dying wife and was constrained in a refrigerated suit. It was groundbreaking. Of course the most complex character in the entire show is the Caped Crusader himself. ![Batman Silhouetted by Lightning](img/batman5.jpg) Bruce Wayne had witnessed the death of his own parents at the age of eight and ever since that night he had dedicated his life to fighting evil. In addition to training to be an expert detective and fighter, Bruce Wayne is the head of a major company that regularly donates to charity. Batman adopted Dick Grayson, Robin, after Dick's parents are murdered much like his own parents. Every night he faces criminals and supervillains, yet he manages to maintain appearances for social events. Batman did all of this in the name of his dead parents, and that requires superhuman time management skills. The (relative) realism found within all of these characters give the viewer empathy toward the actions these people may commit, and it is up to the watcher to justify their actions if possible.\n\nOften times in *Batman: The Animated Series*, there wasn't an easy answer to the questions raised which revealed a truth: life isn't black or white but actually a series of circumstances that create the hands of fate. In the episode \"Two-Face,\" Batman defeats Harvey Dent ![Batman Villain Two-face](img/batman6.jpg) by throwing a box of silver dollars on the ground as Dent flips his own coin that determined if his hostage would die, making him mentally break down when he can't find his among the other coins. It was established early in the episode that Harvey Dent had anger issues that manifested into an alternate personality at a young age, so the question of Dent being conscious of his actions was raised. It was unclear if Dent was a bad guy. There was no revelry on Batman's side despite his victory. In fact, there was quite a bit of crying. It all ended on a sad note, making it more nuanced than that of the typical superhero cartoon.\n\nAlthough there are many points that support *Batman: The Animated Series* as a piece of high art, there is an argument to be made that it is actually low art (Plescher). ![High Art Comparison Chart ](img/batman7.jpg) \"Low art\" is often categorized as mass produced and for a wide audience. Popular culture is often seen as the same as low culture and the show is part of pop culture (\"High and Low\"). Using the transitive relation, that makes Batman low art. Granted, anything that has action figures made for it is difficult to be deemed as \"not intended for a wide audience,\" ( and I am positive that I have some Batman action figures in my basement). There is truth to that, in the fact that the wide audience intention and subsequent commercialization aspect does deafen its ability to be defined as true high art. However, it is because the aspects that made it a candidate for high art overshadow the low art characteristics, thus making it push through the boundaries between the two.\n\nBy utilizing fantastic animation and art design, this show is a visual work of art. The animated series fleshed out realistic characters, (as realistic as a living lump of clay can be,) that challenge the ideas of evil. ![Another Silhouette of Batman](img/batman8.jpg) It also broke new ground in animation and in comics by introducing new characters and concepts to the tedium. *Batman: The Animated Series* has paved the way for further appreciation of graphic novels and animated television shows.\n\n### Works Cited\nBurnett, Alan. \"Two-Face.\" *Batman: The Animated Series*. 25 Sept. 1992.

It is something that comments on the human condition and yet is aesthetically pleasing. Both graphic novels and cartoons have a rightful place in the eyes of high art, and that fact could not be more evident than in the classic fusion of the two mediums in <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> (TAS).</p>\n<p>Given the time that it was created in 1992, <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> had superb animation and art design. Character models were based off of Bruce Timm’s designs, which modernized Batman characters’ appearances without making them dated by today’s standards. The movements of the various characters were slow, yet detailed. A single frame is a work of art. Unlike the over-exaggerated actions of cartoons from that time, <img src=\"img/batman1.jpg\" alt=\"Batman Villain Clayface\"> the movements of each character are realistic. For example, during the two-part episode “Feat of Clay,” Batman faces the super villain Clayface. This particular episode was animated excellently, because it demonstrated Clayface’s moldable, liquid-like abilities through smooth animation.</p>\n<p>Fight scenes in the original animated series were not as quickly paced as those found in future cartoons like Justice League Unlimited, however <img src=\"img/batman2.jpg\" alt=\"Batman Villain Joker\"> this is not a detriment to the show. Every impact was felt and the occasions where quicker animation were used would be exciting. In “The Demon’s Quest,” the sword fight between Ra’s Al Ghul and Batman was faster, making it tense and full of energy.</p>\n<p>The show also employed use of shadows and minimalist art for the title cards and the actual show, which is appropriate for the tone of <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>. The use of shadows made it easier to animate, thus adding fluidity to the movements. Through silhouettes, a feeling of power and mystery was made whenever a character is shown in darkness with only a few features showing. In the episode “The Laughing Fish,” as The Joker staggers away Batman appears in shadow looming over Joker. It was an extremely intimidating frame; this noir motif matched the show’s darker tone compared to the light-hearted comedic shows that shared its channel like Tiny Toons and Animaniacs.</p>\n<p>One of the greatest praises <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>  received was due to its superior voice acting. Kevin Conroy is the definitive Batman, using two different voices to portray  Batman and Bruce Wayne - the former is deep and subdued, while the latter is higher pitched and  emotive. His performance was so well received that Conroy continues to be The Dark Knight’s voice to this day. Conroy’s costar Mark Hamill voiced the Joker and brought a manic energy to the role. He perfectly balanced playfulness and psychopathic sadism in his voice. Unsurprisingly, Hamill was nominated in 1994 for Best Achievement for Voice Acting for his role as The Joker.</p>\n<p>Through the sheer power of their voices, Conroy and Hamill brought life to these characters and remain inseparable from them.</p>\n<p>Aspects from the show actually influenced the comic and animated world. Everyone’s favorite killer jester, Harley Quinn, made her debut in <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>. Her main purpose was to be just another henchman for the Joker, but due to her popularity she was introduced into the comic’s universe. Police detective Renee Montoya had a similar situation, but the only difference was that she was <img src=\"img/batman3.jpg\" alt=\"Batman Villain Harley Quinn\"> introduced into comics right before the show’s airing. As an older villain, Mr. Freeze’s origin was revamped in order to match with the serious nature of the show. This change stuck for the mainstream comics due to it being high quality. The aforementioned Clayface was also visually updated in the comics to be more akin to his animated counterpart. All of these new characters and changes are still in existence in movies, comics, and more cartoons. Because this show had brought characters like Mr. Freeze and Harley Quinn into the limelight, they will always permeate through time.</p>\n<p><em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> was the gateway for more DC comics animated shows. After the success of Batman’s show, the creators started Superman: The Animated Series, which took place in the same universe. Following that was the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited <img src=\"img/batman4.jpg\" alt=\"Batman Villian Mr. Freeze\"> cartoons.  From 1992 to 2006 cartoons based on DC comics within a cohesive continuity and serious stories had been popular thanks to Batman. In other words, this show was the standard for animation and graphic novels and a foundation upon which future animated comic book shows were built for fourteen years.</p>\n<p>The characters were the show’s greatest strength. While there wasn’t an overarching story, most of the episodes dealt with some kind of social issue. Mental health issues were a common theme, each of Batman’s villains represented a different type: Poison Ivy symbolized the evils of fanatical activism and eco terrorism, Two-Face or Harvey Dent was a metaphor for split personality disorder, and the Joker was the personification of chaos (“Arkham Sessions”).</p>\n<p>The show created three-dimensional characters that many sympathize with.

Everytime I see you, you’re busy judging those who are different from yourself. You raise yourself up by forcing others beneath your feet. Prejudice, I will get straight to the point: I don’t like you. In fact, I hate you with a passion. You’re the root of all forms of discrimination. You make weapons out of words and more than once aimed your sword at me. I try to fight back but your words do sting.\n\nPrejudice, do you remember the time when I started playing tennis? You told me that I will lose my femininity by gaining unpleasant muscles and ugly tan lines. You said that sports are not meant for girls because of the risk of injuries. In your opinion, girls should not overexert themselves and stick to easier pastimes. You told me to quit but I refused to listen. Prejudice, I am glad that I chose tennis over you. Although I will acknowledge that tan lines are undesirable because of personal aesthetics, I do not detest them as you want me to. I embrace them because they are the proof of my hard work. I refuse to fulfill your expectations; also, I wouldn’t call my muscles unpleasant. I’m actually proud of them along with the injuries I have sustained and I do not understand why you think I would become less feminine by playing tennis. It’s one of the most graceful and mesmerizing sports out there. Prejudice, you also told me that I would not succeed in tennis because I look weak and small and that no one would take me seriously. I beg to differ as the ex-captain of my highschool team.\n\nYou make me angry, Prejudice. Not only do you belittle me as an athlete because I’m a female, my appearance seems to be of vital importance to you, though I don’t understand why you are concerned with my appearance. I cannot recall how it affects you in any way. If you happen to see me in a dress and heels with makeup on, you tell your friends that I’m trying too hard. If you see me bareface in comfortable clothes, you say that I’m not trying hard enough. What exactly do you want from me then? I don’t dress for you to criticize. I dress for my own satisfaction, not yours. I know that I cannot compare to the picture perfect beauties in your magazines, but let me tell you a little secret: magazine pictures are enhanced with digital software.\n\nMy choice in clothing is not the only aspect of my appearance that you judge. Prejudice, you often have ridiculous expectations and make assumptions about me because of my race. I cannot count how many times you have asked me, “Are you Chinese?” or try to convince me that Japan and China are one and the same. For your information, Japan and China are two different countries with a historically bloody relationship. You automatically think that academics comes naturally to everyone in my race. You wouldn’t know how much school stresses me out and how much effort I put into studying. You’re also always shocked about my perfect English. I don’t know why you expect my English to be poor because I’m not a foreigner; I grew up in New Jersey.\n\nPrejudice, at least when you stand alongside strangers, I have different means of releasing my frustration and anger. It’s much more difficult for me when you stand alongside the people I love, because I don’t know how to respond when you tempt the people precious to me into degrading strangers standing across the street. How do I respond when someone I love points out a tired looking man in dirty clothes and comments that the man is probably on drugs? This is all your fault, Prejudice. You corrupted their minds and I blame you for it.\n\nIt’s also strange when I feel your presence at family parties that you’re not welcome to. I rarely invite my friends to these parties because you make them uncomfortable with your presence. Eating habits, clothing choices, height, size, facial structure, and language are only a small portion of your judging criteria. You manipulate the people around me into consenting with your views and they are at your mercy. You’re the whispered insults and the crude jokes made about my friends’ weight; to which you expect me to laugh at, but I disappoint your expectations when I don’t. You’re the dirty looks given towards my friends who adorn tattoos and piercings and I know about your attempts in manipulating my parents into believing that my friends are terrible influences for my siblings and I. Unfortunately for you, I won’t fall victim to your games. I will choose who my friends are based solely on their character and nothing else.\n\nI do have to give you credit for your fairness though, Prejudice. You judge everyone equally negative. You base your judgements on the wrongdoings of the a problematic minority and automatically apply it to the innocent majority. For this reason, you believe that Catholics are mindless puppets of the Church and Atheists are cold-hearted with no morals. You neither think about the progressive Catholics nor the charitable Atheists. To you, the affluents do not deserve their wealth but the homeless deserve their poverty. You forget that not all wealthy individuals are filled with greed and not all homeless people are lazy. You don’t consider personal hardships people face when making your judgements. You dismiss the younger generations because of their lack of experience and ignore the elderly because they’re not current with the times. You make assumptions about certain groups of people because the innocent majority don’t matter to you, as long as they’re affiliated with the problematic minority in any form. No one can escape your scrutiny.\n\nPrejudice, you already know how much I hate you. I hate seeing you everywhere I go.You are in books, movies, and on social media. I hear you in the news and in the voices of strangers. What’s worse is that sometimes you appear on the faces of the people I love. I detest everything about you but, did you know there’s something else that I despise even more?

For this reason, you believe that Catholics are mindless puppets of the Church and Atheists are cold-hearted with no morals. You neither think about the progressive Catholics nor the charitable Atheists. To you, the affluents do not deserve their wealth but the homeless deserve their poverty. You forget that not all wealthy individuals are filled with greed and not all homeless people are lazy. You don’t consider personal hardships people face when making your judgements. You dismiss the younger generations because of their lack of experience and ignore the elderly because they’re not current with the times. You make assumptions about certain groups of people because the innocent majority don’t matter to you, as long as they’re affiliated with the problematic minority in any form. No one can escape your scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Prejudice, you already know how much I hate you. I hate seeing you everywhere I go.You are in books, movies, and on social media. I hear you in the news and in the voices of strangers. What’s worse is that sometimes you appear on the faces of the people I love. I detest everything about you but, did you know there’s something else that I despise even more? I loathe most that I see you every morning in the mirror because as much as I try to distance myself away from you, you’re a part of me too.</p>\n<p>\f</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br>Trinh Nguyen</p>\n"},{"title":"Depressive Ways","author":"Clara Cribb","layout":"article","headerimage":"img/header-depressiveways.jpg","accentimage":"img/accent-image-depressiveways.jpg","accenttext":"Mending a broken arm does appear to be more conceivable, then fixing a broken mind, but it isn’t impossible.","_content":"Last summer, I was lying in bed with my laptop on my stomach scrolling through Craigslist, looking at houses. For the past couple of weekends that’s really all I’d been doing: scanning through Craigslist, Zillow, and Trulia of houses for rent, writing down phone numbers, and emailing landlords (many of which did not return with a response). This would be the third time in six years that my family and I have moved from house to house. Each of those previous houses had their fair share of problems. It was either poor construction of the house with slanted floorboards or large cracks in the window sills, a shitty landlord that would take months to even acknowledge these problems, inconsiderate neighbors that would blast 2 Chainz at 3 o’clock in the morning, or all the above. . .at the same damn time. It was just one of those things where you’ve tried to get ahold of the situation and work with these problems, but at the end there’s nothing you could do. Eventually, I’d gotten used to the moving.\n\nIt was nothing new on that night. It was just a regular night in bed doing what I did two times before. Out of nowhere, it became hard for me to breathe. Each inhale was more difficult than the last, like forcing air through a pinched straw. At first, I thought it was because I had my laptop on my stomach for too long, not allowing enough oxygen inside of my lungs. I pushed it to the side and sat up on the edge of my bed, but that seemed to make my breathing even worse. I got up from the bed, walked to the bathroom and plopped down on the edge of the tub. Bent over with my elbows on my knees, I was trying to figure out what in the hell was happening to me. I’d never experienced this before. Heat rose from my neck to the rim of my eyes making them water softly. I stood up from the edge of the tub with my hand on my chest. Breathing heavily, the pressure from my chest began getting tighter and I started to cry. I didn’t want to cry. Forcing the tears back formed a hard lump in my throat, and made my heart beat faster than it already was. I didn’t know why I was crying in the first place. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was having a panic attack. Unknowingly, I had suppressed the frustrations of being ignored by our current landlord and the exhaustion of not finding a decent home. I was okay with everything, or at least I tricked myself into thinking I was.\n\nI haven’t been to my therapist in a couple of months. The surprise panic attack gave me more than enough motivation to seek out a therapist, but I hadn’t had any other sudden attacks or woke up most mornings being angry at myself and unsuspecting family members for no obvious reason. I just suddenly stopped going. I strongly give credit to the prescription pills she suggested I take to balance me out and calm my nerves; Fluoxetine for depression and Propranolol for anxiety. Once a day and every day. For some odd reason, a little part of me thought I was fixed or close to it. That phrase sounds rather silly and ignorant. Fixed, like I’m some sort of household appliance that abruptly stopped functioning properly or a car that has tons of mileage on it that could breakdown on the highway at any moment. Breaking down is something that I don’t do very often, but more than enough that I’m willing to accept. I’ve had breakdowns where I would cry at weird and embarrassing times, but never like that night in the bathroom. It just snuck up on me. I shouldn’t even call it a breakdown. My therapist disclosed to me that they are acute panic attacks; the sudden onset of overwhelming anxiety and fear and no, there is nothing cute about it. That is exactly what she said. I could only guess it was her attempt of lightening up the mood. It did not work. These acute panic attacks are sneaky, sneaky little bastards.\n\nSince I was 14 years old, I’ve misunderstood those nights of lying in bed alone and crying myself to sleep because of the unforgiving thoughts in my mind wouldn’t let up. I had failed to acknowledge some days of waking up in the morning in a lousy mood before my feet even touched the floor. For a long while I didn’t know it, but I have what the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM for short) calls Major Depressive Disorder. Let me break this down for you: unlike most people that feel sad or low at some points in their lives, people with MDD are depressed most of the day and have lost interest in the things that they’d once enjoyed. These symptoms of being in a depressive mood lasts every day for at least two weeks. Other symptoms that accompany this depressive mood: not having the energy or the motivation to get up from bed every morning (fatigue), facing people that you don’t know how to interact with without looking awkward so you don’t (anxiety), not eating anything for the whole day because you can’t stop thinking about what other people think about you (worthlessness), therefore making you physically sick to the point where your eating habits are almost nonexistent or over the top for an extended period of time (weight loss and gain). Yes, that’s what individuals like myself go through every single day. I just thought I was stressed out about some insignificant things that I was making into a massive thing, not a chemical imbalance causing problems with my brain function.\n\nThere is a kind of humiliation behind mental disorders and psychotherapy preventing individuals from seeking mental health treatment. Many people believe that having a mental illness makes them weak and unpredictable and that if someone finds out about it, they wouldn’t want to be a part of their lives anymore. Clinical psychologist Nikki Massey-Hastings stated that many people feel embarrassed or ashamed of their symptoms because our society places illogical taboos on mental health issues over physical conditions. Mending a broken arm does appear to be more conceivable, then fixing a broken mind, but it isn’t impossible. Many people also believe that they should be able to handle their feelings and situations by themselves without any help, but having an outsider that truly cares about your wellbeing can be very helpful and insightful. Sometimes, just having someone to listen is all that’s needed. Unfortunately, there are some careless outsiders that’s telling someone that they’ll get over it or they’re faking it, which makes it even harder for them to seek help and to openly talk about it. This creates self-doubt, going back and forth with oneself of whether their symptoms are serious enough; thus, stopping them from actively seeking help. They’re not sure what certain feelings or how intense they should be that justifies a therapy session. Many times, I’d fought within myself of deciding if I needed help. The depression didn’t seem urgent enough to me and I thought I could handle it on my own. I kept this extraordinary kind of pain from my mother, my grandmother, and other loved ones. I would try my hardest to ignore the looming darkness; painting on a synthetic happy face when going out, and starting a journal to release the gloomy words that had been boiling inside throughout that day. The journaling did help and I have a great deal of pages filled with real and deep thoughts, but that could only do so much.\n\nFamily members could unknowingly make the stresses of dealing with a mental disorder difficult and deter those from seeking professional help. It seems like the most logical and comfortable thing to do is to turn to a loved one, hashing out foreign feels that interrupt your life and intrudes your inner home. But, that isn’t always the case. Loved ones might want to suggest well-meaning, but poor advice on what’s going on with you and how to deal with what’s being felt. People that are suffering with various mental disorders may be told that they’re just going through a phase; repeating that “everything is going to be okay.” I’ve been told by some family members that I’m just a moody person and I need to get over it, but that was before I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Since my diagnosis, it opened the dialogue and the minds of my loved ones and made it easier for me to share my inner issues. Sadly, some don’t have that kind of support. Sometimes, the ones that are the closest to you, hurt you the most. If one could cut open oneself, all the emotions, all the feelings would spill out and present themselves. But, it isn’t that simple and it cuts deeper than the skin. It’s hard to face all of that alone, but the hardest part about therapy is walking through the door for the first time, so you won’t have to deal with this alone.\n\nIt’s an early September morning and I wake up feeling something that I verbally cannot explain. I manage to gather enough energy and sit on the edge of the bed. *Maybe I should just cancel and reschedule for another time. I mean, I’ve waited this long to actually pick up the phone and make an appointment to see a therapist.* I look at the blinds hanging from the window next to my bed; pieces of white light shimmering through each slit. I get up, walk to the bathroom, and start getting dressed quickly if I don’t want to be late.\n\nI look at the rain skipping on the passenger window with my hand resting underneath my chin. Maybe it’s the sunless sky or the wet ground. Maybe it’s the chill in the air making the inside and the outside of me feel numb. *What will I say when I get there? Oh god, I hope I don’t cry. I haven’t cried in front of anyone for a long time and I don’t want to make it feel even more awkward than I already know it’s going to be.* My mother and I are pulling up to a small brick building. My heart is beating so fast that it feels like it could stop at any moment. I turn to look at my mom. She recognizes the uncertainty in my eyes. She lends me a well-needed warm smile and reassures me that I will be okay. The need to be reminded was necessary and comforting. I open the car door and run up to the entrance, hesitant to go inside and face whatever it is on the other side. I take a deep breath, then slowly open the door, and walk in.

I didn’t know it at the time, but I was having a panic attack. Unknowingly, I had suppressed the frustrations of being ignored by our current landlord and the exhaustion of not finding a decent home. I was okay with everything, or at least I tricked myself into thinking I was.</p>\n<p>I haven’t been to my therapist in a couple of months. The surprise panic attack gave me more than enough motivation to seek out a therapist, but I hadn’t had any other sudden attacks or woke up most mornings being angry at myself and unsuspecting family members for no obvious reason. I just suddenly stopped going. I strongly give credit to the prescription pills she suggested I take to balance me out and calm my nerves; Fluoxetine for depression and Propranolol for anxiety. Once a day and every day. For some odd reason, a little part of me thought I was fixed or close to it. That phrase sounds rather silly and ignorant. Fixed, like I’m some sort of household appliance that abruptly stopped functioning properly or a car that has tons of mileage on it that could breakdown on the highway at any moment. Breaking down is something that I don’t do very often, but more than enough that I’m willing to accept. I’ve had breakdowns where I would cry at weird and embarrassing times, but never like that night in the bathroom. It just snuck up on me. I shouldn’t even call it a breakdown. My therapist disclosed to me that they are acute panic attacks; the sudden onset of overwhelming anxiety and fear and no, there is nothing cute about it. That is exactly what she said. I could only guess it was her attempt of lightening up the mood. It did not work. These acute panic attacks are sneaky, sneaky little bastards.</p>\n<p>Since I was 14 years old, I’ve misunderstood those nights of lying in bed alone and crying myself to sleep because of the unforgiving thoughts in my mind wouldn’t let up. I had failed to acknowledge some days of waking up in the morning in a lousy mood before my feet even touched the floor. For a long while I didn’t know it, but I have what the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM for short) calls Major Depressive Disorder. Let me break this down for you: unlike most people that feel sad or low at some points in their lives, people with MDD are depressed most of the day and have lost interest in the things that they’d once enjoyed. These symptoms of being in a depressive mood lasts every day for at least two weeks. Other symptoms that accompany this depressive mood: not having the energy or the motivation to get up from bed every morning (fatigue), facing people that you don’t know how to interact with without looking awkward so you don’t (anxiety), not eating anything for the whole day because you can’t stop thinking about what other people think about you (worthlessness), therefore making you physically sick to the point where your eating habits are almost nonexistent or over the top for an extended period of time (weight loss and gain). Yes, that’s what individuals like myself go through every single day. I just thought I was stressed out about some insignificant things that I was making into a massive thing, not a chemical imbalance causing problems with my brain function.</p>\n<p>There is a kind of humiliation behind mental disorders and psychotherapy preventing individuals from seeking mental health treatment. Many people believe that having a mental illness makes them weak and unpredictable and that if someone finds out about it, they wouldn’t want to be a part of their lives anymore. Clinical psychologist Nikki Massey-Hastings stated that many people feel embarrassed or ashamed of their symptoms because our society places illogical taboos on mental health issues over physical conditions. Mending a broken arm does appear to be more conceivable, then fixing a broken mind, but it isn’t impossible. Many people also believe that they should be able to handle their feelings and situations by themselves without any help, but having an outsider that truly cares about your wellbeing can be very helpful and insightful. Sometimes, just having someone to listen is all that’s needed. Unfortunately, there are some careless outsiders that’s telling someone that they’ll get over it or they’re faking it, which makes it even harder for them to seek help and to openly talk about it. This creates self-doubt, going back and forth with oneself of whether their symptoms are serious enough; thus, stopping them from actively seeking help. They’re not sure what certain feelings or how intense they should be that justifies a therapy session. Many times, I’d fought within myself of deciding if I needed help. The depression didn’t seem urgent enough to me and I thought I could handle it on my own. I kept this extraordinary kind of pain from my mother, my grandmother, and other loved ones. I would try my hardest to ignore the looming darkness; painting on a synthetic happy face when going out, and starting a journal to release the gloomy words that had been boiling inside throughout that day. The journaling did help and I have a great deal of pages filled with real and deep thoughts, but that could only do so much.</p>\n<p>Family members could unknowingly make the stresses of dealing with a mental disorder difficult and deter those from seeking professional help. It seems like the most logical and comfortable thing to do is to turn to a loved one, hashing out foreign feels that interrupt your life and intrudes your inner home. But, that isn’t always the case. Loved ones might want to suggest well-meaning, but poor advice on what’s going on with you and how to deal with what’s being felt. People that are suffering with various mental disorders may be told that they’re just going through a phase; repeating that “everything is going to be okay.” I’ve been told by some family members that I’m just a moody person and I need to get over it, but that was before I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Since my diagnosis, it opened the dialogue and the minds of my loved ones and made it easier for me to share my inner issues. Sadly, some don’t have that kind of support. Sometimes, the ones that are the closest to you, hurt you the most. If one could cut open oneself, all the emotions, all the feelings would spill out and present themselves. But, it isn’t that simple and it cuts deeper than the skin. It’s hard to face all of that alone, but the hardest part about therapy is walking through the door for the first time, so you won’t have to deal with this alone.</p>\n<p>It’s an early September morning and I wake up feeling something that I verbally cannot explain. I manage to gather enough energy and sit on the edge of the bed. <em>Maybe I should just cancel and reschedule for another time. I mean, I’ve waited this long to actually pick up the phone and make an appointment to see a therapist.</em> I look at the blinds hanging from the window next to my bed; pieces of white light shimmering through each slit. I get up, walk to the bathroom, and start getting dressed quickly if I don’t want to be late.</p>\n<p>I look at the rain skipping on the passenger window with my hand resting underneath my chin. Maybe it’s the sunless sky or the wet ground. Maybe it’s the chill in the air making the inside and the outside of me feel numb. <em>What will I say when I get there? Oh god, I hope I don’t cry. I haven’t cried in front of anyone for a long time and I don’t want to make it feel even more awkward than I already know it’s going to be.</em> My mother and I are pulling up to a small brick building. My heart is beating so fast that it feels like it could stop at any moment. I turn to look at my mom. She recognizes the uncertainty in my eyes. She lends me a well-needed warm smile and reassures me that I will be okay. The need to be reminded was necessary and comforting. I open the car door and run up to the entrance, hesitant to go inside and face whatever it is on the other side. I take a deep breath, then slowly open the door, and walk in. The hardest part is over.</p>\n"},{"title":"Understanding Our Era of Intolerance","author":"Sabah Halim","layout":"article","headerimage":"img/header-eraofintolerance.jpg","accenttext":"Faith is intended to bring peace and civility to people, no matter how different one’s beliefs may be.","accentimage":"img/accent-image-eraofintolerance.jpg","_content":"“Subhanalla-thee sakh-khara-lana haatha wa-ma kun-na lahoo muqrineena wa inna ila Rabbina la-mun-qali-boon.”\n\nThis is an Islamic invocation summoning Allah. Frightening? Most people may believe so, but a clear understanding of this prayer will ease the fear. It is intended to evoke peace and safety, as this is a prayer recited before embarking on a journey. Appropriately, this paper intends to take its readers on a journey as well. More specifically, this paper will take its readers on a journey from the fear of Islam, or of any religion, to an understanding of religion’s peaceful nature. The correct interpretation of Islam, is unknown to the general public. In fact, the true interpretations of many religions are hidden behind the manipulation of religious teachings and crimes of extremist groups. The fear of extremism of religious organizations directly translates to fear of their religions, but I argue that the ideologies they supposedly follow do not encourage extremists; instead, cultural and political influences dictate their crimes and motives.\n\nFear comes from ignorance. Humanity tends to fear the unknown, especially when it comes to intangible concepts like faith. In the last two decades following the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001; America’s judgment of faith has targeted Muslims and immigrants alike who follow religions other than the predominant Christianity; typically including religions originating from South Asia and the Middle East. Fear of religion from these regions translates to the discrimination of followers of these faiths. This, in turn, translates further into physical violence, and even war and genocide. The organizations that commit crimes associate themselves with Islam, and claim to fight in the name of God. Because of their claims, people generally believe what they say. If they say that Islam teaches them to hate America, then many people will believe them. If they act violent towards America, saying that their religion teaches them to take vengeance, then people will continue to believe them. However, what many people do not know is that the claims of these terrorist organizations or individuals are in fact diametric to the true teachings of their faith. Because this is not recognized, Islam is misinterpreted as a dangerous religion characterized by hatred; evil; and animosity for the west. This misunderstanding is directly relatable to all faiths that have faced discrimination because of misrepresentations of their religions.\n\nThe individuals who claim to fight in the name of their religions are often the ones who know the least about their religions. Their ignorance is misunderstood as strong belief and piety. In Islam, “peace is characterized by an absence of not only physical violence, but also of internal ruinations caused by the preponderance of vicious attributes in the spiritual and mental faculties” (Hamid and Mydin 157-158). To Muslims who practice Islam correctly, nonviolence and healthy, kind attitudes towards others is important. However, these terrorist groups fight to kill, contradicting the true teachings of Islam, or any other religion. They believe that they are justified in harming others, convincing people that their beliefs can be generalized to all Muslims. Their conviction to their cause is what gives way to great misinterpretation of the differences between their beliefs and the general public’s beliefs. Those who seem to represent their religion in the face of violent vindication arguably know the least about the faiths they claim to uphold.\n\nOne of the factors that cause this violent vindication is political conflict. The political demands of certain countries are perceivably interrelated to religious allegiances. However, this perception is not true. It is common for countries to establish an official state religion, but integrating the religion with political governing leads people to believe that religion solely rules that state. It is important to realize that this is a concept that applies to religions from all over the world; Islam is not solely victim to this. For example, Russia is a predominantly Orthodox Christian religion. However, the government’s ties to the Russian Orthodox Church are intensifying by the decade, and it provides little to no comfort to the general Russian public. In 2012, a group of young women performed a controversial song in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ condemning the church’s influence on President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. Their performance was criticized as a public disturbance characterized by religious hatred. Like many other Russians, they firmly believe that religion plays too significant of a role in politics. A major problem is that “religion and politics can rarely, if ever, be brought into complete alignment. Religious leaders who engage in politics must find a way to bridge the space between their political allegiances and religion” (Edwards 271-272); which is seldom accomplished, especially in Russia.\n\nFor example, the Ukrainian-Russian crisis in which Christian, Russian-supported rebels are fighting for territory in a predominantly Catholic Ukraine. It is a political conflict in which Putin’s Russia aims to conquer the land of Ukraine to acquire more military power. However, there are disputes over religious differences and the Russian Orthodox Church’s strong support for Putin. Violent protests, bombings, and killings continue in Ukraine and millions of citizens reside in danger and fear. Thus, the conflict is perceived as a battle over religious freedom of Ukraine. Ultimately, religion is considered the reason for conflict. However, this type of danger is solely the product of politically motivated interests, and not of the differences in faith. Especially in this current event, political motives are masked by religious endeavors.\n\nIt is important to question why religion is so often utilized as a scapegoat to disguise political conflicts of interest. Without this inquisition, we are subject to manipulation by powerful scheming authorities that can easily gain influence over the people they lead. This is especially significant in the recent United States 2016 Presidential Election. Donald Trump, the current President-Elect, is notorious for manipulation in search for political gain. His maneuvering has given way to a significant surge in religious intolerance in the United States due to divisions that already existed prior to Donald Trump’s prominent political influence. Religious divisions were further deepened because of his derogatory claims against certain religions and its believers. The deepened intolerance led to terrorism in the form of personal attacks on civilians and religious places of gathering. The resurgence of religious hatred is rooted from Donald Trump’s political agenda to retain votes from specific demographics. America witnessed him systematically condemn Muslims nationwide, and after his success in the election, he receded from his racist claims because he finally won the election. He ignited deep religious intolerance throughout the country for his own political motives, but even though he later discredited his earlier acclamations, the hatred has not subsided. Without realizing this, we are subject to continuous manipulation by shrewd leaders who are able to sense the vulnerability of gullible citizens.\n\nThe vulnerability of citizens comes to play a significant role on the fate of millions of people in a country. This is evident in Pakistan, an Islamic Republic located in South Asia. In Kashmir, a northwestern region in Pakistan, young boys are especially vulnerable to corrupt extremist teachings because the public education system in the region has collapsed. Consequently, their education is derived from “religious schools that teach very little about Islam besides small verses of the Qur’an” (AAANEWs). Instead of teaching the correct version of Islam, militant Islam is encouraged statewide. Therefore, ongoing conflicts between India and Pakistan further reside and young, strong adults are coerced into fighting a battle that is not theirs. The two nations are on the brink of nuclear conflict, because of confrontation that has survived for decades with no resolution.\n\nThe conflict originated in 1947 when the British receded from India following two centuries of colonial rule. Colonial rule was imposed in efforts to instill political and social influence in the region. Britain’s departure created a division between Indians and Pakistanis who peacefully coincided together before Britain’s colonization. For years to follow, Indians and Pakistanis will continue to fight over the highland of Kashmir that was left unclaimed by the British. The region was originally under the rule of a Hindu leader who wanted to proclaim Kashmir a province of the state of India; however, because the majority of the region’s civilians are Muslim, they “considered Kashmir as a natural part of their own cultural contested boundary” (AAANEWs). From then until today, fighting is motivated by competition over land. From outside viewers, this is a religious conflict between two parties who want to proclaim their faiths as the overall supreme. However, the truth behind the misconceptions shows that this is, in fact, violence rooting from political vendettas.\n\nCivilians of other nations prove to be just as vulnerable as the young boys in Kashmir. Because of unreliable resources, civilians are persuaded to believe that countries like India and Pakistan are fighting purely religious battles; thus, they represent their religions. Consequently, they are led to believe that radicals are accurate representatives of their faiths. Then, all people of the same faith are generalized to resemble the same violent upbringing; thus, religious intolerance and hatred ensues. It is because of this fallacy that further researching the history of such regions and the true motives behind violent conflict is most crucial in understanding the power of misinterpretation. Without this, social conflicts reside among citizens who are vulnerable to their lack of historical background knowledge and accurate news resources.\n\nSocial conflicts are very often misconstrued as religious conflicts. Often times, when conflicts are mentioned with religion, the battle is portrayed as an insurgence of religious animosity that never before existed in that region until recent events. However, there is always an underlying historical social conflict that is ignored in the interpretation of such conflicts. The creation of the Islamic religious group, Al Qaeda, in Iraq, is direct proof of this. In Iraq, two types of Muslims reside: Shiites and Sunnis. Being that these are two different sects of Islam, they follow different practices. In 2003, the American government replaced Iraq’s Sunni government with Shiite leaders. With the Shiites in power, the predominantly Sunni population became unemployed; they lost their political influence, and the upper class Sunnis were robbed of their assets. Because of these new social constructs, animosity towards the Shiite government grew; thus, Iraq became a breeding ground for Al Qaeda. The significance of this history is that in order to legitimize religiously fueled conflict, it is crucial to understand that “a development process which does not respect the cultural and historical reality of the people it intends to benefit is bound to be violent and cause insecurity” (Kanyandago 237). The history of a Shiite government ruling a predominantly Sunni Iraq is often overlooked, or barely mentioned when acknowledging religious tensions in the region. With this in mind, history proves it impossible to have religious conflict without cultural and historical rifts that create divergence. Disagreements over religious fundamental beliefs are merely supplemental to the underlying causes of conflict, which root from historical and cultural discrepancy.\n\nSocially, extremism thrives on close connections between people, not devotion to faith. From these close connections come trust, alliance, and brotherhood. Without these communal facets, there is no faith between group members. “Membership to a violent extremist or terrorist group is more likely to be a factor of the group’s social function than its particular ideology” (Aly and Jason-Leigh 856). Extreme religious organizations rely heavily on a culture of brotherhood, and not on piety like some people believe. Piety plays a much less significant role in radicalism than is perceived. “According to the FBI, “re-interpretation [of religion] is a key aspect of radicalization” (Aly and Jason-Leigh 855). Radicals will re-interpret religious teachings in a way to fit their discontent and personal vendettas. Thus, when they are recognized for acts of violence, they are once again taken as representatives of their faith. Because of their criminal actions, their faiths are misunderstood as dangerous teachings. Contrary to claiming to fight in the name of their God, these people will ultimately create more havoc. This leads to more discrimination against their faith, and fighting will continuously escalate between both parties. Spreading their word is what allows radicals to thrive; therefore, social interactions are most significant in radicals’ overall operation. Ultimately, it is obvious that if radicals were true believers and participants of their faith, they would not fight to kill and eliminate political enemies. More importantly, they would not reach to broaden their mission to all corners of the earth. It is nearly impossible to deny that extremism thrives on the success of societal connections.\n\nFear of religion roots from misinterpretation and misleading resources. Different world leaders, social media outlets, news sources, and civilians blame religious differences for the criminal hostility supervening in different regions of the world today and throughout history. History has proven that these religious differences are used to mask political and social conflicts of interest. Faith is intended to bring peace and civility to people, no matter how different one’s beliefs may be. What is acquired in fighting for the justification of a religion? There is no motivation other than hatred, hostility, and danger. As members of the human race, our duty is to look after our friends, families, and neighbors. This includes people from all across the globe. I implore us all to carefully analyze why we treat our neighbors the way that we do, and to question ourselves by asking: what led me to believe this, and is it rightfully justified? Hopefully in doing this, we will delve deeper into the root causes of illegitimate fear, and begin to denounce religious discrimination. Religion is not a cause of violence; ignorance, deception, and corruption are the real cause of violence. Religion embodies the concept of inner peace, encouraging love between our brothers and sisters all across the world. Yet, we manipulate this idea to conceal the real problems that bring us to the brink of war. The alarming reality is that most people do not comprehend the root causes of conflicts that do not directly affect us, but affect our brothers and sisters overseas, even in neighboring states. This can be because they do not care for a problem that does not bother them personally, or they simply choose to ignore the truth. On that note, we must leave the conversation by reflecting back on the characteristics of humanity by wondering, what does this say about us as people?\n\n### Works Cited\nAAANEWs. “LOW LEVEL WAR IN KASHMIR.” Religious Tolerance, 14 Dec. 2016, www.religioustolerance.org/war_kash.htm\n\nAly, Anne, and Jason-Leigh Striegher. \"Examining The Role Of Religion In Radicalization To Violent Islamist Extremism.\" *Studies In Conflict & Terrorism* 35.12 (2012): 849-862.

This leads to more discrimination against their faith, and fighting will continuously escalate between both parties. Spreading their word is what allows radicals to thrive; therefore, social interactions are most significant in radicals’ overall operation. Ultimately, it is obvious that if radicals were true believers and participants of their faith, they would not fight to kill and eliminate political enemies. More importantly, they would not reach to broaden their mission to all corners of the earth. It is nearly impossible to deny that extremism thrives on the success of societal connections.\n\nFear of religion roots from misinterpretation and misleading resources. Different world leaders, social media outlets, news sources, and civilians blame religious differences for the criminal hostility supervening in different regions of the world today and throughout history. History has proven that these religious differences are used to mask political and social conflicts of interest. Faith is intended to bring peace and civility to people, no matter how different one’s beliefs may be. What is acquired in fighting for the justification of a religion? There is no motivation other than hatred, hostility, and danger. As members of the human race, our duty is to look after our friends, families, and neighbors. This includes people from all across the globe. I implore us all to carefully analyze why we treat our neighbors the way that we do, and to question ourselves by asking: what led me to believe this, and is it rightfully justified? Hopefully in doing this, we will delve deeper into the root causes of illegitimate fear, and begin to denounce religious discrimination. Religion is not a cause of violence; ignorance, deception, and corruption are the real cause of violence. Religion embodies the concept of inner peace, encouraging love between our brothers and sisters all across the world. Yet, we manipulate this idea to conceal the real problems that bring us to the brink of war. The alarming reality is that most people do not comprehend the root causes of conflicts that do not directly affect us, but affect our brothers and sisters overseas, even in neighboring states. This can be because they do not care for a problem that does not bother them personally, or they simply choose to ignore the truth. On that note, we must leave the conversation by reflecting back on the characteristics of humanity by wondering, what does this say about us as people?\n\n### Works Cited\nAAANEWs. “LOW LEVEL WAR IN KASHMIR.” Religious Tolerance, 14 Dec. 2016, www.religioustolerance.org/war_kash.htm\n\nAly, Anne, and Jason-Leigh Striegher. \"Examining The Role Of Religion In Radicalization To Violent Islamist Extremism.\" *Studies In Conflict & Terrorism* 35.12 (2012): 849-862.

Frightening? Most people may believe so, but a clear understanding of this prayer will ease the fear. It is intended to evoke peace and safety, as this is a prayer recited before embarking on a journey. Appropriately, this paper intends to take its readers on a journey as well. More specifically, this paper will take its readers on a journey from the fear of Islam, or of any religion, to an understanding of religion’s peaceful nature. The correct interpretation of Islam, is unknown to the general public. In fact, the true interpretations of many religions are hidden behind the manipulation of religious teachings and crimes of extremist groups. The fear of extremism of religious organizations directly translates to fear of their religions, but I argue that the ideologies they supposedly follow do not encourage extremists; instead, cultural and political influences dictate their crimes and motives.</p>\n<p>Fear comes from ignorance. Humanity tends to fear the unknown, especially when it comes to intangible concepts like faith. In the last two decades following the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001; America’s judgment of faith has targeted Muslims and immigrants alike who follow religions other than the predominant Christianity; typically including religions originating from South Asia and the Middle East. Fear of religion from these regions translates to the discrimination of followers of these faiths. This, in turn, translates further into physical violence, and even war and genocide. The organizations that commit crimes associate themselves with Islam, and claim to fight in the name of God. Because of their claims, people generally believe what they say. If they say that Islam teaches them to hate America, then many people will believe them. If they act violent towards America, saying that their religion teaches them to take vengeance, then people will continue to believe them. However, what many people do not know is that the claims of these terrorist organizations or individuals are in fact diametric to the true teachings of their faith. Because this is not recognized, Islam is misinterpreted as a dangerous religion characterized by hatred; evil; and animosity for the west. This misunderstanding is directly relatable to all faiths that have faced discrimination because of misrepresentations of their religions.</p>\n<p>The individuals who claim to fight in the name of their religions are often the ones who know the least about their religions. Their ignorance is misunderstood as strong belief and piety. In Islam, “peace is characterized by an absence of not only physical violence, but also of internal ruinations caused by the preponderance of vicious attributes in the spiritual and mental faculties” (Hamid and Mydin 157-158). To Muslims who practice Islam correctly, nonviolence and healthy, kind attitudes towards others is important. However, these terrorist groups fight to kill, contradicting the true teachings of Islam, or any other religion. They believe that they are justified in harming others, convincing people that their beliefs can be generalized to all Muslims. Their conviction to their cause is what gives way to great misinterpretation of the differences between their beliefs and the general public’s beliefs. Those who seem to represent their religion in the face of violent vindication arguably know the least about the faiths they claim to uphold.</p>\n<p>One of the factors that cause this violent vindication is political conflict. The political demands of certain countries are perceivably interrelated to religious allegiances. However, this perception is not true. It is common for countries to establish an official state religion, but integrating the religion with political governing leads people to believe that religion solely rules that state. It is important to realize that this is a concept that applies to religions from all over the world; Islam is not solely victim to this. For example, Russia is a predominantly Orthodox Christian religion. However, the government’s ties to the Russian Orthodox Church are intensifying by the decade, and it provides little to no comfort to the general Russian public. In 2012, a group of young women performed a controversial song in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ condemning the church’s influence on President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. Their performance was criticized as a public disturbance characterized by religious hatred. Like many other Russians, they firmly believe that religion plays too significant of a role in politics. A major problem is that “religion and politics can rarely, if ever, be brought into complete alignment. Religious leaders who engage in politics must find a way to bridge the space between their political allegiances and religion” (Edwards 271-272); which is seldom accomplished, especially in Russia.</p>\n<p>For example, the Ukrainian-Russian crisis in which Christian, Russian-supported rebels are fighting for territory in a predominantly Catholic Ukraine. It is a political conflict in which Putin’s Russia aims to conquer the land of Ukraine to acquire more military power. However, there are disputes over religious differences and the Russian Orthodox Church’s strong support for Putin. Violent protests, bombings, and killings continue in Ukraine and millions of citizens reside in danger and fear. Thus, the conflict is perceived as a battle over religious freedom of Ukraine. Ultimately, religion is considered the reason for conflict. However, this type of danger is solely the product of politically motivated interests, and not of the differences in faith. Especially in this current event, political motives are masked by religious endeavors.</p>\n<p>It is important to question why religion is so often utilized as a scapegoat to disguise political conflicts of interest. Without this inquisition, we are subject to manipulation by powerful scheming authorities that can easily gain influence over the people they lead. This is especially significant in the recent United States 2016 Presidential Election. Donald Trump, the current President-Elect, is notorious for manipulation in search for political gain. His maneuvering has given way to a significant surge in religious intolerance in the United States due to divisions that already existed prior to Donald Trump’s prominent political influence. Religious divisions were further deepened because of his derogatory claims against certain religions and its believers. The deepened intolerance led to terrorism in the form of personal attacks on civilians and religious places of gathering. The resurgence of religious hatred is rooted from Donald Trump’s political agenda to retain votes from specific demographics. America witnessed him systematically condemn Muslims nationwide, and after his success in the election, he receded from his racist claims because he finally won the election. He ignited deep religious intolerance throughout the country for his own political motives, but even though he later discredited his earlier acclamations, the hatred has not subsided. Without realizing this, we are subject to continuous manipulation by shrewd leaders who are able to sense the vulnerability of gullible citizens.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability of citizens comes to play a significant role on the fate of millions of people in a country. This is evident in Pakistan, an Islamic Republic located in South Asia. In Kashmir, a northwestern region in Pakistan, young boys are especially vulnerable to corrupt extremist teachings because the public education system in the region has collapsed. Consequently, their education is derived from “religious schools that teach very little about Islam besides small verses of the Qur’an” (AAANEWs). Instead of teaching the correct version of Islam, militant Islam is encouraged statewide. Therefore, ongoing conflicts between India and Pakistan further reside and young, strong adults are coerced into fighting a battle that is not theirs. The two nations are on the brink of nuclear conflict, because of confrontation that has survived for decades with no resolution.</p>\n<p>The conflict originated in 1947 when the British receded from India following two centuries of colonial rule. Colonial rule was imposed in efforts to instill political and social influence in the region. Britain’s departure created a division between Indians and Pakistanis who peacefully coincided together before Britain’s colonization. For years to follow, Indians and Pakistanis will continue to fight over the highland of Kashmir that was left unclaimed by the British. The region was originally under the rule of a Hindu leader who wanted to proclaim Kashmir a province of the state of India; however, because the majority of the region’s civilians are Muslim, they “considered Kashmir as a natural part of their own cultural contested boundary” (AAANEWs). From then until today, fighting is motivated by competition over land. From outside viewers, this is a religious conflict between two parties who want to proclaim their faiths as the overall supreme. However, the truth behind the misconceptions shows that this is, in fact, violence rooting from political vendettas.</p>\n<p>Civilians of other nations prove to be just as vulnerable as the young boys in Kashmir. Because of unreliable resources, civilians are persuaded to believe that countries like India and Pakistan are fighting purely religious battles; thus, they represent their religions. Consequently, they are led to believe that radicals are accurate representatives of their faiths. Then, all people of the same faith are generalized to resemble the same violent upbringing; thus, religious intolerance and hatred ensues. It is because of this fallacy that further researching the history of such regions and the true motives behind violent conflict is most crucial in understanding the power of misinterpretation. Without this, social conflicts reside among citizens who are vulnerable to their lack of historical background knowledge and accurate news resources.</p>\n<p>Social conflicts are very often misconstrued as religious conflicts. Often times, when conflicts are mentioned with religion, the battle is portrayed as an insurgence of religious animosity that never before existed in that region until recent events. However, there is always an underlying historical social conflict that is ignored in the interpretation of such conflicts. The creation of the Islamic religious group, Al Qaeda, in Iraq, is direct proof of this. In Iraq, two types of Muslims reside: Shiites and Sunnis. Being that these are two different sects of Islam, they follow different practices. In 2003, the American government replaced Iraq’s Sunni government with Shiite leaders. With the Shiites in power, the predominantly Sunni population became unemployed; they lost their political influence, and the upper class Sunnis were robbed of their assets. Because of these new social constructs, animosity towards the Shiite government grew; thus, Iraq became a breeding ground for Al Qaeda. The significance of this history is that in order to legitimize religiously fueled conflict, it is crucial to understand that “a development process which does not respect the cultural and historical reality of the people it intends to benefit is bound to be violent and cause insecurity” (Kanyandago 237). The history of a Shiite government ruling a predominantly Sunni Iraq is often overlooked, or barely mentioned when acknowledging religious tensions in the region. With this in mind, history proves it impossible to have religious conflict without cultural and historical rifts that create divergence. Disagreements over religious fundamental beliefs are merely supplemental to the underlying causes of conflict, which root from historical and cultural discrepancy.</p>\n<p>Socially, extremism thrives on close connections between people, not devotion to faith. From these close connections come trust, alliance, and brotherhood. Without these communal facets, there is no faith between group members. “Membership to a violent extremist or terrorist group is more likely to be a factor of the group’s social function than its particular ideology” (Aly and Jason-Leigh 856). Extreme religious organizations rely heavily on a culture of brotherhood, and not on piety like some people believe. Piety plays a much less significant role in radicalism than is perceived. “According to the FBI, “re-interpretation [of religion] is a key aspect of radicalization” (Aly and Jason-Leigh 855). Radicals will re-interpret religious teachings in a way to fit their discontent and personal vendettas. Thus, when they are recognized for acts of violence, they are once again taken as representatives of their faith. Because of their criminal actions, their faiths are misunderstood as dangerous teachings. Contrary to claiming to fight in the name of their God, these people will ultimately create more havoc.

It was August 20, 2002, one of my last days of that year’s summer camp, when my father picked me up in our new family hauler — a dark red Honda CR-V that he and my mother affectionately named Rhonda. My first love. Rhonda the Honda. To say Rhonda was pretty would have to be said with strange facial contortions; it would be said through squinted eyes and a voice a few octaves higher than usual, usually accompanied by a shrug or six. But she was a Honda and that meant she was cheap and very reliable, something perfect for our little middle class family. She was a replacement for my mother’s fourteen-year-old Honda Civic, called Wanda the Honda, oddly enough. The only memory I had of Wanda was a huge spider crushed in one of the doors that literally mentally scarred me for life. No wonder I didn’t mind seeing Wanda go. Plus, now we had Rhonda. Rhonda would shoulder our burdens on long trips to Cooperstown, Boston, or even just the sandy shores of Stone Harbor.\n\nThe first car I fell in love with was my dad’s old Ford Escort station wagon he named Fred. Fred died on a hot summer day in 2006 at the Cherry Hill Mall parking lot. For some reason, I had to choke back tears while staring out of Rhonda’s back hatch as we drove away with a heat mirage rising up and enveloping Fred’s dark blue exterior. My parents spoke in hushed, angry tones in the front seats about the next thing to do; my father had to drive to a train station every day and my mother to her job at a local newspaper twenty minutes from home, so they needed two cars. I pressed my face up against Rhonda’s rear seat backs and watched as Fred grew smaller and smaller, letting the khaki-colored fabric imprint my skin with square shapes. At least we still had her. Her maroon exterior sparkled in the late August sun and her khaki-colored interior was firm yet warm; like a mother that pushes hard but is always there when times get tough.\n\nOwnership of Rhonda moved from my mother to my father when Fred died and my mother had bought a slightly used dark gray Toyota Corolla she named Gaston, after a now former Philadelphia Flyers goalie. Rhonda was getting up there in years now, but she showed no signs of malfunction. She was a Honda through and through and was built to withstand anything. She lived through hurricanes, ridiculous blizzards, and so much more. She had dings, scratches, cracks, and bad brakes, but she was ours.\n\nRhonda was special to me because of how long she was in my life. We got her when I was six and I sold her when I was twenty. That’s fourteen years of my life, seventy fucking percent of it, that I spent with Rhonda. She was there for the best and the worst parts of my life, from weddings to funerals and everything in between. She had taken me on dates and coddled me after breakups. She was a constant. I was sixteen when I learned to drive, and I did it in Rhonda. I was eighteen when she officially became mine, after my father bought a brand new Volkswagen hatchback for himself. I got a couple of clip-on window American flags to put on the rear windows and Rhonda became The Iron Patriot, going by Rhonda only to her close friends and family.\n\nShe had her quirks and that was part of the reason why she was so special to me. One such quirk was that the front two seat belts would only properly clasp if hit with the passenger’s wrist from a very specific angle. Another was that the rear passenger doors didn’t lock with the universal locking mechanism on the driver’s side, but rather had to be operated manually. That was what caused me to be locked out of the car in the middle of nowhere with no phone, shirt, or shoes for an hour and a half before I shattered a window, unlocked the door, and embarrassingly drove home.\n\nThe Iron Patriot accompanied me alone for roughly twenty-five thousand miles. She made appearances in different states, drove up and back to my best friend’s house in Freehold several times, and had many times undergone the stereotypical teenage rite of passage — backseat summer car sex. The Iron Patriot was especially important in the formation of a long distance relationship. I had met a girl staying in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania for a few weeks and made the thirty-five-or-so-minute journey there and back a dozen or more times in those few weeks. The young woman and I laughed, kissed, fucked, and loved in The Iron Patriot. Bathed in her headlights, I tearfully bid this young woman goodbye for a few months before I would fly to her home state to visit her, leaving The Iron Patriot alone for five days to relax under a low autumn sun. The Iron Patriot, through all of this life experience, saw it all. They saw objects or places can sometimes become haunted if they see enough emotional anguish or energy, so I’d say that there’s a good shot that today some poor kid has a haunted, fourteen-year-old CR-V.\n\nNaturally, the aforementioned long distance relationship came to a close. It was late one Sunday night (or Monday morning, depending on your point of view) in early January. I was sitting in my car after a late, lone viewing of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscar-winning performance in *The Revenant.* My long term, long distance relationship was about to end. I knew it, and she knew it. We’d hardly spoken for six days. I decided that it was a good time to reach out and say “hey,” while sitting alone in my car at 1:30 in the morning.\n\n*Ring ring.* Nothing. Listening to the dial tone, I stared at the front of the theater through The Iron Patriot’s frost-covered windshield.\n\n*Ring ring.* Still nothing. Light snow had began to fall, reflecting color in all directions as it glided softly down in front of the theater’s blue neon letters.\n\n*Ring ri—* “Hello?” her voice sounded tired.\n\n“Hey,” I said back.\n\n“What’s up?”\n\n“I, uh, just got out of a movie. Thought I’d see what’s up.”\n\n“Thought you’d see what’s up, huh?”\n\n“Yep.”\n\n“Well, I just got into bed. I’ll talk to you later.”\n\n“Oh, uh…okay. Bye. I love y—” the line was dead.\n\nI threw my phone into the back seat and punched the ceiling of my poor Rhonda as hard as I could, making a slight dent. She was Rhonda to me that night, after an extremely intimate and emotional experience she and I shared together that I somehow coped with alone.\n\nI sat in the lot for a while, caressing my now-red knuckles and enjoying the silence and the snow. I watched the last of the cars pull out of the lot as a thin, powdery white built on Rhonda’s windshield wipers. I watched cracks in the asphalt fill up while the rest of the tarmac sat speckled and frozen like the crusted surface of an icy sea. I watched the neon blue letters spelling CARMIKE flicker and turn off as the snow piled softly on top of them. When it reached half an inch, I decided I’d stop wallowing in self-pity and go home. The world was cold, but life went on.\n\nThe next few months were weird. I was in school, sure, and working, but I got it in my head that I should start looking for a different car. Not a new one, I had an idea of what I wanted (preferably late-‘90s or early 2000s Hondas), but a different car. I knew I was going to be getting rid of The Iron Patriot. A few times I stopped and told myself I’d drive her until she died and I was *forced* to get rid of her, but the desire to get something else always won out. My parents were really on the side of me getting a new car too; they’d worried about their only child driving a fourteen-year-old crossover whose steering wheel shook past fifty miles an hour up and down the highway seven days a week all over and through the dips and bends of New Jersey. I can’t say that I blame them looking back.\n\nIn late May of last year, Honda’s newly redesigned Civic coupes went on sale. One of the colors was an obnoxious “energy green pearl” as deemed by Honda, and I was hooked. I was willing to get rid of my beloved Patriot for this green…thing. A Friday in early June my father accompanied me to a nearby Honda dealership where I would seal the deal. I was getting rid of Rhonda. I test drove this green Civic and was happy enough with it. It was fast (although fast to me after driving The Iron Patriot for three years could have been a wheelchair on ice), nimble, and quiet. I was sold. It would help me build credit. It was much better on gas, much more attractive, and way safer. What could go wrong? What was wrong with this plan? There was nary a doubt in my mind that this was the right call and so I decided to sell The Iron Patriot and use that money as a downpayment on this new Civic I had started to call Maxine.\n\nAbout three quarters of the way through the dealings, I was hit with incredible remorse. I was actually going to have to leave my Rhonda behind. My back was to the dealership’s outer windows where she sat in the rain, staring in at me. I made the mistake of turning around to look at her and started to sob. Not a quiet, remorseful sob, but rather a loud and ugly one. That car was the only thing besides my parents to be constant in my life for seventy percent of it. I sobbed harder and harder and still she sat staring at me, rain collecting on her windshield and hood. Her big, triangular headlights gleamed brightly at me as they became covered in rain. It looked like she was crying too. I couldn’t believe how attached I was to her; I never thought the day would come when I would actually have to get rid of my Rhonda. My father tried consoling me but it was no real use. I was a wreck. He was emotional too, but not making a scene the way I was.\n\nI had left the table to go clean myself up in the bathroom where a kind old mechanic helped to console me. I was rubbing my eyes at the sink and washing my face with cold water when I felt a large hand pat me on the shoulder.\n\n“You okay, son?” he asked me.\n\n“Y-Yeah,” I managed to stammer out. “I’m selling my first car. She’s been in my life for fourteen years.”\n\n“Oh,” he looked at me with soft compassion and then smiled faintly. “I’ll take care of her for you.”\n\nI looked at him and tried to muster up some positive emotion but couldn’t. He smiled again, looked down, and walked out.\n\nWhile startlingly kind for a stranger, his words only made me sob harder. I eventually cleaned myself up and walked back to our negotiating table, where Rhonda’s plates sat in the middle, warped and weathered, a startling contrast. I looked out the window to where she was parked and she was gone. My father had asked the people at the dealership to pull her away before we left so I wouldn’t have to drive past her, wet and alone, in my brand new spotless Civic that didn’t have issues with its locks or seat belts or its steering wheel shaking. It was very considerate and I still think it’s one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.\n\nI left the dealership that day in much better shape than I was in a few paragraphs ago, still sad but beguiled at how well equipped even base model cars are these days. My Civic, Maxine, is great. She drives wonderfully, is fun around corners, has a nice little growl to her, and currently does 36.1 miles per gallon, giving me approximately four hundred and thirty five miles to a tank. She’s pretty to look at and I always get compliments on her color, but she isn’t the CR-V. Not a day goes by where I don’t think of my Iron Patriot, Rhonda, the car that picked me up from summer camp at age six, that I grew up in, that was my own personal love shack from ages seventeen to twenty, that was simultaneously one of my closest friends and best nurturing figures. What I experience on a daily basis because of Rhonda is an emotion known on this world as “regret.” Her license plates hang next to my bed, warped and weathered, a reminder of the old days, as if I could ever forget.\n\nEveryone remembers their first love.\n","source":"rhonda.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Rhonda\nauthor: Sam Lyons\nlayout: article\nheaderimage: img/header-rhonda.jpg\naccenttext: In life, every American remembers two things — their first car and their first love.\naccentimage: img/accent-image-rhonda.jpg\n---\nIn life, every American remembers two things — their first car and their first love.

Not a new one, I had an idea of what I wanted (preferably late-‘90s or early 2000s Hondas), but a different car. I knew I was going to be getting rid of The Iron Patriot. A few times I stopped and told myself I’d drive her until she died and I was <em>forced</em> to get rid of her, but the desire to get something else always won out. My parents were really on the side of me getting a new car too; they’d worried about their only child driving a fourteen-year-old crossover whose steering wheel shook past fifty miles an hour up and down the highway seven days a week all over and through the dips and bends of New Jersey. I can’t say that I blame them looking back.</p>\n<p>In late May of last year, Honda’s newly redesigned Civic coupes went on sale. One of the colors was an obnoxious “energy green pearl” as deemed by Honda, and I was hooked. I was willing to get rid of my beloved Patriot for this green…thing. A Friday in early June my father accompanied me to a nearby Honda dealership where I would seal the deal. I was getting rid of Rhonda. I test drove this green Civic and was happy enough with it. It was fast (although fast to me after driving The Iron Patriot for three years could have been a wheelchair on ice), nimble, and quiet. I was sold. It would help me build credit. It was much better on gas, much more attractive, and way safer. What could go wrong? What was wrong with this plan? There was nary a doubt in my mind that this was the right call and so I decided to sell The Iron Patriot and use that money as a downpayment on this new Civic I had started to call Maxine.</p>\n<p>About three quarters of the way through the dealings, I was hit with incredible remorse. I was actually going to have to leave my Rhonda behind. My back was to the dealership’s outer windows where she sat in the rain, staring in at me. I made the mistake of turning around to look at her and started to sob. Not a quiet, remorseful sob, but rather a loud and ugly one. That car was the only thing besides my parents to be constant in my life for seventy percent of it. I sobbed harder and harder and still she sat staring at me, rain collecting on her windshield and hood. Her big, triangular headlights gleamed brightly at me as they became covered in rain. It looked like she was crying too. I couldn’t believe how attached I was to her; I never thought the day would come when I would actually have to get rid of my Rhonda. My father tried consoling me but it was no real use. I was a wreck. He was emotional too, but not making a scene the way I was.</p>\n<p>I had left the table to go clean myself up in the bathroom where a kind old mechanic helped to console me. I was rubbing my eyes at the sink and washing my face with cold water when I felt a large hand pat me on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“You okay, son?” he asked me.</p>\n<p>“Y-Yeah,” I managed to stammer out. “I’m selling my first car. She’s been in my life for fourteen years.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” he looked at me with soft compassion and then smiled faintly. “I’ll take care of her for you.”</p>\n<p>I looked at him and tried to muster up some positive emotion but couldn’t. He smiled again, looked down, and walked out.</p>\n<p>While startlingly kind for a stranger, his words only made me sob harder. I eventually cleaned myself up and walked back to our negotiating table, where Rhonda’s plates sat in the middle, warped and weathered, a startling contrast. I looked out the window to where she was parked and she was gone. My father had asked the people at the dealership to pull her away before we left so I wouldn’t have to drive past her, wet and alone, in my brand new spotless Civic that didn’t have issues with its locks or seat belts or its steering wheel shaking. It was very considerate and I still think it’s one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.</p>\n<p>I left the dealership that day in much better shape than I was in a few paragraphs ago, still sad but beguiled at how well equipped even base model cars are these days. My Civic, Maxine, is great. She drives wonderfully, is fun around corners, has a nice little growl to her, and currently does 36.1 miles per gallon, giving me approximately four hundred and thirty five miles to a tank. She’s pretty to look at and I always get compliments on her color, but she isn’t the CR-V. Not a day goes by where I don’t think of my Iron Patriot, Rhonda, the car that picked me up from summer camp at age six, that I grew up in, that was my own personal love shack from ages seventeen to twenty, that was simultaneously one of my closest friends and best nurturing figures. What I experience on a daily basis because of Rhonda is an emotion known on this world as “regret.” Her license plates hang next to my bed, warped and weathered, a reminder of the old days, as if I could ever forget.</p>\n<p>Everyone remembers their first love.</p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"","more":"<p>In life, every American remembers two things — their first car and their first love. It was August 20, 2002, one of my last days of that year’s summer camp, when my father picked me up in our new family hauler — a dark red Honda CR-V that he and my mother affectionately named Rhonda. My first love. Rhonda the Honda. To say Rhonda was pretty would have to be said with strange facial contortions; it would be said through squinted eyes and a voice a few octaves higher than usual, usually accompanied by a shrug or six. But she was a Honda and that meant she was cheap and very reliable, something perfect for our little middle class family. She was a replacement for my mother’s fourteen-year-old Honda Civic, called Wanda the Honda, oddly enough. The only memory I had of Wanda was a huge spider crushed in one of the doors that literally mentally scarred me for life. No wonder I didn’t mind seeing Wanda go. Plus, now we had Rhonda. Rhonda would shoulder our burdens on long trips to Cooperstown, Boston, or even just the sandy shores of Stone Harbor.</p>\n<p>The first car I fell in love with was my dad’s old Ford Escort station wagon he named Fred. Fred died on a hot summer day in 2006 at the Cherry Hill Mall parking lot. For some reason, I had to choke back tears while staring out of Rhonda’s back hatch as we drove away with a heat mirage rising up and enveloping Fred’s dark blue exterior. My parents spoke in hushed, angry tones in the front seats about the next thing to do; my father had to drive to a train station every day and my mother to her job at a local newspaper twenty minutes from home, so they needed two cars. I pressed my face up against Rhonda’s rear seat backs and watched as Fred grew smaller and smaller, letting the khaki-colored fabric imprint my skin with square shapes. At least we still had her. Her maroon exterior sparkled in the late August sun and her khaki-colored interior was firm yet warm; like a mother that pushes hard but is always there when times get tough.</p>\n<p>Ownership of Rhonda moved from my mother to my father when Fred died and my mother had bought a slightly used dark gray Toyota Corolla she named Gaston, after a now former Philadelphia Flyers goalie. Rhonda was getting up there in years now, but she showed no signs of malfunction. She was a Honda through and through and was built to withstand anything. She lived through hurricanes, ridiculous blizzards, and so much more. She had dings, scratches, cracks, and bad brakes, but she was ours.</p>\n<p>Rhonda was special to me because of how long she was in my life. We got her when I was six and I sold her when I was twenty. That’s fourteen years of my life, seventy fucking percent of it, that I spent with Rhonda. She was there for the best and the worst parts of my life, from weddings to funerals and everything in between. She had taken me on dates and coddled me after breakups. She was a constant. I was sixteen when I learned to drive, and I did it in Rhonda. I was eighteen when she officially became mine, after my father bought a brand new Volkswagen hatchback for himself. I got a couple of clip-on window American flags to put on the rear windows and Rhonda became The Iron Patriot, going by Rhonda only to her close friends and family.</p>\n<p>She had her quirks and that was part of the reason why she was so special to me. One such quirk was that the front two seat belts would only properly clasp if hit with the passenger’s wrist from a very specific angle. Another was that the rear passenger doors didn’t lock with the universal locking mechanism on the driver’s side, but rather had to be operated manually. That was what caused me to be locked out of the car in the middle of nowhere with no phone, shirt, or shoes for an hour and a half before I shattered a window, unlocked the door, and embarrassingly drove home.</p>\n<p>The Iron Patriot accompanied me alone for roughly twenty-five thousand miles. She made appearances in different states, drove up and back to my best friend’s house in Freehold several times, and had many times undergone the stereotypical teenage rite of passage — backseat summer car sex. The Iron Patriot was especially important in the formation of a long distance relationship. I had met a girl staying in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania for a few weeks and made the thirty-five-or-so-minute journey there and back a dozen or more times in those few weeks. The young woman and I laughed, kissed, fucked, and loved in The Iron Patriot. Bathed in her headlights, I tearfully bid this young woman goodbye for a few months before I would fly to her home state to visit her, leaving The Iron Patriot alone for five days to relax under a low autumn sun. The Iron Patriot, through all of this life experience, saw it all. They saw objects or places can sometimes become haunted if they see enough emotional anguish or energy, so I’d say that there’s a good shot that today some poor kid has a haunted, fourteen-year-old CR-V.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the aforementioned long distance relationship came to a close. It was late one Sunday night (or Monday morning, depending on your point of view) in early January. I was sitting in my car after a late, lone viewing of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscar-winning performance in <em>The Revenant.</em> My long term, long distance relationship was about to end. I knew it, and she knew it. We’d hardly spoken for six days. I decided that it was a good time to reach out and say “hey,” while sitting alone in my car at 1:30 in the morning.</p>\n<p><em>Ring ring.</em> Nothing. Listening to the dial tone, I stared at the front of the theater through The Iron Patriot’s frost-covered windshield.</p>\n<p><em>Ring ring.</em> Still nothing. Light snow had began to fall, reflecting color in all directions as it glided softly down in front of the theater’s blue neon letters.</p>\n<p><em>Ring ri—</em> “Hello?” her voice sounded tired.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” I said back.</p>\n<p>“What’s up?”</p>\n<p>“I, uh, just got out of a movie. Thought I’d see what’s up.”</p>\n<p>“Thought you’d see what’s up, huh?”</p>\n<p>“Yep.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I just got into bed. I’ll talk to you later.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, uh…okay. Bye. I love y—” the line was dead.</p>\n<p>I threw my phone into the back seat and punched the ceiling of my poor Rhonda as hard as I could, making a slight dent. She was Rhonda to me that night, after an extremely intimate and emotional experience she and I shared together that I somehow coped with alone.</p>\n<p>I sat in the lot for a while, caressing my now-red knuckles and enjoying the silence and the snow. I watched the last of the cars pull out of the lot as a thin, powdery white built on Rhonda’s windshield wipers. I watched cracks in the asphalt fill up while the rest of the tarmac sat speckled and frozen like the crusted surface of an icy sea. I watched the neon blue letters spelling CARMIKE flicker and turn off as the snow piled softly on top of them. When it reached half an inch, I decided I’d stop wallowing in self-pity and go home. The world was cold, but life went on.</p>\n<p>The next few months were weird. I was in school, sure, and working, but I got it in my head that I should start looking for a different car.

Regardless of this heat, my grandfather stood peacefully beside my house dressed in his go-to outfit: a suit and tie. He was a gentleman; poised, yet brittle, and smelt of plants, spices, and smoke. With his hands clasped tightly together behind his back, and his toes as his single source of balance, he bent over to take a peek at our magnificent magenta roses.\n\nHe hovered over them and admired their aromas, just like we all do over a freshly baked batch of cookies. Then he pulled away, and with a crooked smile, pointed to a particular rose. I struggled to stretch my body far enough to view this unique flower, but once I recognized what made it oh-so “special,” I instantly folded back to the ground like an accordion.\n\nThere was a family of five bees on this one rose, and I thought one was going to go up my nose!  My grandfather thought differently. He told me, “If all of these bees are fighting over this single rose, imagine how exceptional its fragrance must be.” He seemed crazy, but after the monsters flew away, we both took a waft, and he was right. This freshly blossomed rose had an aroma that was sweeter and more elegant than any flower I’d ever smelled before; its perfume was as thick and rich as red velvet, and lingered within my senses even after I walked away. I’ll never forget it’s tantalizing fragrance.\n\nMy grandfather mastered the art of smelling roses. He shared tips with me like, “The darker a rose’s color or the more petals it has, the more fragrant the scent!”  But his appreciation for roses was only a fraction of his overall appreciation for life. He possessed an innate empathetic nature by consistently remaining present and assuring the people surrounding him that they mattered. Even as the sole breadwinner for a household of fifteen, he prioritized the time he spent with family, and noticed that the mundane moments in life are what made it so worthwhile. He emphasized, “Make time to share memorable experiences with others. Savor everything and everyone you’re blessed with. Be present.”\n\nAnd as I grew older, he told me, “You have to work hard and make things happen, but also, you need to take a step back and let things happen.” Our natural world’s beauty is temporary, our relationships with our friends and family are temporary; therefore, we should intend to enjoy whatever time we have. My grandfather deliberately lived by the expression, “to stop and smell the roses.”\n\nWhen he died, it felt as though every rose on Earth was ripped out of the ground. My family sensed the flower’s piercing thorns, rather than its smooth petals. It felt as though he took parts of my identity with him. I don’t why I recognized the subtle backgrounds in my life and their positive impacts after they disappeared. During the wintertime, I missed the fragrance of roses welcoming me into my household, and during family get-togethers, I missed the presence of my grandfather. Whenever he was near, he’d radiate warmth, making sure I feel at home. He made my family complete. I hated how our roses continued to bloom even though he was no longer here, but as time rolled by, the endless life cycle of a rose, through its birth and death, brought me relief. I gained reassurance once I realized that as long as the scent of my grandfather’s adored roses carries on, so will he.\n\nIt’s been five years since he’s passed, and now every time I see a luscious rose in my front yard, I take a moment to absorb its bittersweet qualities. His scent remains with them. It feels like he’s still here; still in his suit and tie, teaching me about the everyday beauties of the world. I believe that everyone should stop and smell the roses, because their scent is the most comforting scent in the world.\n","source":"smellslikehome.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Smells Like Home\nauthor: Aisha Bilal\nlayout: article\nheaderimage: img/header-smellslikehome.jpg\naccentimage: img/accent-image-smellslikehome.jpg\naccenttext: Our natural world’s beauty is temporary, our relationships with our friends and family are temporary; therefore, we should intend to enjoy whatever time we have.\n---\nI strolled onto my front porch in a light cotton dress, and sensed the pounding hot fists of summer onto my body.

I look like an uptight bitch.  \nIf I take it out is she going to notice?  \nThat'd be worse than looking like I just left the gym.  \nThen she'd be onto me being into her.  \nI have no clue if she'd be into being onto me.  \nI'm taking my hair out.  \n\nI threw everything associated with her out, even the shampoo that we shared – well I kept the conditioner, but it's not like she used it; her hair was so short. Utterly black and coarse like tulle, tufts of bangs sprouted from her forehead. I’d always brush them aside in the morning to venture into her hazel eyes. I feel like it’s a common comparison to say eyes are like the universe, but hers were like a forest; a mixture of earth tones like greens and browns. If you lie amidst the trees and look up, the light shines through the canopy of leaves in such a way that almost does justice to the iridescence in her eyes.\n\nShe's looking at me, I know it.  \nI should've kept my hair up.  \nShe knows.  \nAnother.  \nWhy’d I even come to the bar by myself?   \nOh yeah, because my friends chose the ex over me.  \nThe bartender keeps staring at my boobs, Christ.  \nThis guy’s a beef-head.  \nBum night. I just want to close my tab.   \nI’m not even tipping this guy.   \nHe probably drugged me, whatever.  \nSome buxom blonde plants herself on the stool next to me.  \nCompliments my hair.  \nAsks about my day.  \nOffers to buy me a drink.  \nShe seems sweet, and she’s stunning.  \nDeny offer.  \nI walk out and try to light a cigarette.  \nI barely smoke, whatever.   \nLighter’s out of fluid: click, click, nothing, shake, click, nothing.  \n*Fuego?*  \nTurn around, and there she is holding out a lighter…  \nLast thing I expected. But ok. Baby balls?  \n…With a pickle design printed on it.  \nCute.   \nAssuming that means she likes pickles.  \nWait, what? Fuck I was a cynical.   \nWho makes their lighter purchase specifically to advertise their sexual preference?  \n“Thanks…”  \n*Winter.*  \n“What?”  \nHa, that's my name.  \n“Your name is Winter?”  \n*Yeah, I like ‘Winnie’ better though. You?*  \n“I like ‘Winnie’ better, too.”  \n*No, your name…*  \n“Oh! Steph. So you like pickles?” – word vomit.  \nShe giggles at both my question and the agony on my face for having asked it.  \n*Only the kind that are green and come in a jar.*   \n\nAt least my apartment wouldn’t smell like weed anymore. She’d store some in my dresser for when she was over; I found a few nugs in the cat’s staple food bag once, whoever knows how they got there. It was one of those big ones from PetSmart that you buy to last you through the next ice age; I’ve been scooping away at the supply for what feels like a century.\n\nPassing a joint, we’d lie on the floor of my apartment on Sunday afternoons in our t-shirts and underwear like something you’d see in a music video: stereotypical lesbian-movie couple, bring in the Arctic Monkeys. We’d have what I thought at the time was deep conversation, but to her it was just high-talk.\n\n“Do you ever feel like something is totally bothering you, and you wish you knew what it was, but you sort of do and you’re just like unconsciously pretending that you don’t?”  \n *What’s bothering you?*  \n“My mind knows but it won’t tell me.”  \n*Then how do you know?*  \n“Instincts.”  \n*Thirsty?*  \n“No.”  \n*Hungry?*  \n“I’m not talking about a lack of basic human necessity that a dry mouth or grumbling stomach will tell me. Not those kind of instincts.”  \n*What kinds then?*  \n“The ones you don’t know about. The ones you haven’t the slightest clue about but you know somehow they’re there. ‘Cause if they weren’t, where would this thought I’m having even come from?”   \n*What’s the matter Steph? Why're you getting all mysterious on me? Lighten up.*  \n“I don't know I just feel like there's all types of things that I should talk about and I just can’t.”  \n*Tell me then, tell me a story.*  \n\nSo I told her about my mom and my dad. I told her about how they kicked me out when I was seventeen-years-old because they found out I liked girls. I told her about the long three years of silence between us until they finally accepted I wasn't going to change where I liked putting my mouth. I told her about how my brother would have his friends sleep over, and that they spied on me changing when I was only fourteen-years-old. I told her that his science partner Jimmy actually came into my room one of those nights and stuck his fingers in my underwear when I had pretended to be asleep, and that I told my parents but they brushed it off as normal “guy stuff.” I told her about how he did it five times after that. I told her about my hamster Charlie I had when I was six-years old, and that he never let me hold him, so one day I got so angry I snatched him out of his cage and squeezed him a little too hard. I told her about how when I was four-years old the priest at our church told me God wouldn’t love me if I didn’t sing loud enough for him to hear. I told her about how every girl I've ever been with has taken me for granted.  \n\n*Mm.*  \n“That's all you have to say?”  \n*What do you want me to say? You're being ‘bad vibes.’ Can't we just have fun?*  \n“Don't we always ‘just have fun.' Do you even take me seriously?”  \n*Why're you talking like this?*  \n“I don’t know, Winnie. Probs the weed.”  \nShe sits up, looking at me with her squinty, glassy eyes, and pouts with her bottom lip curling outward at me.  \n“Why the face?”  \nShe mocks me in a nasally voice.  \n*I dyan’t knyaow Winnie. Prabs tha wee-eed.*  \nShe explodes in laughter, shoots up from the rug like a missile, and let’s herself crash on top of me.   \n\nMaking fun of me was always something she was good at. I miss those little digs she’d squeeze in. She was good at filling in the spaces – gaps in conversation, the empty drawers in my dresser with her spare clothes, the fish bowl when Goldie would belly up. She didn't think I'd notice, but she actually replaced him two times that I’m sure of. I'd humor her by making little comments: “Goldie looks a little bigger today, maybe I’m over-feeding him.”   \n\nFor my birthday she snagged me a booklet of lottery tickets and a bottle of Jim Beam. We scratched the tickets furiously with sticky pennies and when we lost all of them except for two ($5 total were the fruits of our labor), we drowned our poverty-stricken sorrows in whiskey. Since we couldn't afford to get into any glamorous shenanigans that weekend to celebrate, we walked the river and smoked a filtered joint. Every time we saw a daisy she's snatch it up and present it like it was the royal scepter: I picked this for you, milady.   \n\nFor Fourth of July, Winter and I took a bunch of IPAs and laid out a blanket on a hill near the local high school to watch the fireworks. I forgot to bring the bottle opener; I could picture it sitting in the utensil drawer mixed in with the assortment of plastic knives and sporks I’d pocket from fast-food restaurants so I wouldn’t have to do as many dishes. In its absence, Winter brought out her lighter and showed me a trick to get the caps off. Apparently the lighter had to be positioned in this very specific way in order to get the right leverage, and after three failures I decided I didn’t have the knack for it. Plus, why would I need to learn if she’d always be around with her handy technique.\n\nFor Thanksgiving, we ordered out from Boston Market and snagged a box of wine. We took all the food out of the plastic containers and set it up on my dining room table, lit candles, and used real silverware and the good china, Winter called it. Before we ate, she insisted we say what we were thankful for. She began:\n\n*I am thankful for this chicken that has been rotisserie-d.  \nFor the good china.  \nFor the dishwasher.  \nI’m thankful for my homie Steph.  \n‘Cause she’s always there for me.  \na—and, for dessert.  \nWhich is also Steph.*  \nWinks, laughs, launches a spoonful of mashed potatoes at me.\n\nSo desert came and went and we passed out at 9 p.m.   \n\nAnd so it was finally winter; snow layered the ground, frosted the windows, iced-over the roads. We’d gotten to Wawa after driving four miles per hour so Winnie could get a hot chocolate. I asked her if she liked winter, “like, the season.” She said no because it stole her thunder, and how dare winter try to show her up like that. Mother nature’s got nothing on me. I chuckled like I usually did at her sassy remarks, and she smiled mischievously at me like she always did after delivering. I followed up my first question by inviting her to my family’s for dinner. She was really troubled by that, I remember her face twisting up into a reluctant grimace and her standing outside my passenger door craning her neck into the car.\n\n*I’d rather not.*  \nBlank stare.  \n*I don’t think so, Steph.*  \n“Well—”  \n*Why would I do that?*  \nThis time it’s her face that has the blank stare.  \n“Maybe because we’ve been fucking for six months.”  \n*What’s that have to do with literally anything, Steph.*  \nI feel like I’m choking up, like my neck is swelling.  \nMy body goes into high alert.  \nLike a bunch of bells and whistles and sirens screeching in my head.  \nThat familiar wave of rejection engulfs me.  \nSwallows me whole in its heat.  \nThis isn’t something I’m supposed to feel with her.  \nThis isn’t what this is. This isn’t what this is supposed to be.  \nWhat? “What is this supposed to be?”  \n*It’s supposed to be nothing. It’s supposed to be whatever it wants to be.*  \n“You’re the one specifying it’s supposed to be something at all.”  \n*No you are, by asking me to come to your family thing.*  \n“Why wouldn’t I?”  \n*But why would you?*  \nShe slams the car door.  \nI feel like we’re at the furthest corners of the universe from each other.  \nAll alone on my side.  \nAll alone in my Hyundai, my stupid vehicular bubble.  \nShe storms into the Wawa.  \nAnd I scream at the top of my lungs.  \n\nThis girl comes into my life one night at a bar where I’m soaking up my despair for the three months after my last break-up, and gives me a certain happiness I’ve never felt before and a hope that this was the one, this time was different, only to rip that happiness and that hope right out from under me. Winnie approached me at the bar; she sparked a fire in me, only to douse it. I texted her two days later to say sorry and that I should’ve known she wouldn’t want to come to some “corny dinner, my bad. my parents asked me to bring some1, i shouldnt have let them pressure me.” Her response: “its cool homie. wanna go ride bikes or something?” We didn’t talk about it again, and for the next week and through the holiday we went on as we normally did, even though it squeezed my insides into knots, burning like brimstone.\n\nSo who’s the ex and why’d she leave? Rachel. Grade A bitch. Queen of melodrama. She wasn’t your typical looking-lesbian, either. She was hot. Like, really hot. She had long brunette hair always set in soft, loose curls. Her skin was smooth like she lathered herself in butter, smooth and incredibly tan (a good olive tan, too, not that orange spray shit). Her waist was my favorite thing about her, cinched like a corset that swooped outward into hips you could place a glass of water on (at least they seemed that way in comparison to mine – I’m built like a box, like a twelve-year-old boy with a box for a torso). She woke up an hour earlier than she had to before work each morning to perfect her hair and makeup. She wore dresses and skirts, push-up bras and thongs. I don’t even remember the last time I wore a bra. Naturally, when we’d go out together, guys were always all over her, assuming that I was just the ugly best friend. Rach would try so hard to dress me up, *take out your ponytail, don’t wear those jogger pants, put this blouse on, try this lipstick* et cetera, et cetera. I’d get pretty pissed off because, not only was she trying to change me, but she thought that picking up guys at the bar was some kind of game and she wanted me to join her.\n\nSo I’d say the break-up was entirely her fault.  \n\nI’d rather sit at a dive-bar and order some beers.  \nGrab some quesadillas.  \nBut no, I’m sitting here at ‘Rumor.’  \nI hate coming out to places like this.  \n12:58am. Great. This place is open for another hour.  \nWhen Rachel drags me out like this, she’s never ready to leave until last call.  \nI haven’t even seen her in like 20 minutes.  \nForce a conversation with the bartender.  \nHe’s trying to hit on me. Why.   \nWhere’s your boyfriend?  \n*“I’m gay.”*  \nOh.  \nYeah I’m not in the mood for that right now.   \nI’m ready to leave.   \nRachel pulls this shit all the time.  \nShe forces me to come to these clubs filled with a bunch of horny men.  \nDisappears for four hours, and comes back sweaty.  \nFresh off the dance floor.  \nThe ‘DJ,’ if that’s what you want to call him, is blasting some basic dance music.  \nI’m going to find her.  \nCheck the bathroom.  \nNope.  \nWalk the entire floor; wince each time the strobe flashes.  \n*Thump thump thump –*  \n*Cool music bro let’s bump our fists, yeah bro.*  \nSomeone just grabbed my ass.  \nNope.  \nMaybe I’ll bum a smoke.  \nNever mind, Rachel would kill me.  \nThe last time she saw me taking a drag she started crying.  \nActually yeah, I need a fucking cigarette.  \n\nRachel and I dated for two years, and this is what it came down to: a break-up that left me girlfriendless, friendless, depressed, and full of ugly anger. I thought for a long time about moving to a different state, and starting my life completely over. I probably should have. Scratch that – I definitely should have.   \n\nI can hear the repetitive *thump thump thumps* even from outside.   \nAnd there she is.  \nWearing some guy’s jacket.   \nLeaning up against the brick wall.  \nShe’s trashed.  \nShe can’t even keep both of her eyes open at the same time.   \nHis palms are pressed to the wall, arms caging her there.  \nCall her name.  \nNo response.  \nMarch over.  \nSpit out, “You cold Rachel?”  \n*He tells me to fuck off.*  \n“That’s my girlfriend, asshole.”  \n*Not tonight.*  \nGrab her, rip the jacket off.  \nThis dirtbag is approaching me, so I elbow him in his chest.  \nShe’s really cursing at me.  \nHow is she pissed at me right now?  \nI’m the one that’s allowed to be pissed.  \nShe slurs: *Boring dyke.*  \nI yank her away.  \nShe fights to free her wrist.  \n“You want to go? Fine.”  \nLaunch her toward the wall.  \nShe smacks her skull on the brick.  \nOut cold.  \n\nShe told everyone I attacked her. She told everyone I was a fucking violent craze-o. She told everyone she wasn’t doing anything wrong. All of our mutual friends shunned me. They stopped answering my calls. They DeFriended me on Facebook. I actually saw Emily in ShopRite a handful of times, and she made every effort to stay as far away from me as possible. When we did lock eyes, she gave me an injuring look of disgust. When I first saw Winter in the bar, I thought twice about her because she was there with three guy friends. But like I said before, they were pretty gay-looking. Well, non-threatening. I’m not even really that jealous of a person, I don’t think. I just didn’t want a repeat of Rachel-the-lesbian-who’s-not-really-a-lesbian show.\n\nRachel pushed me to my limit. There she was wearing some sketchy man’s jacket, pinned up against a sketchy wall at one in the morning outside of some sketchy bar that the sketchy wall belonged to, looking like she had just washed down ten sketchy drinks. So she got a restraining order. Our friends chose her over me. And that was it. After two years.\n\nThe ball drops in ten minutes.   \nIt took us only about five to drive here.  \nWinter insisted we drive.  \nHappy New Year.   \nShe tells me that she comes to this spot every year.   \nShe loves to listen to the faint echo of pots and pans clanging.  \nShe says the sounds bounce off the buildings and stretch across the water.   \nThe moon’s shrouded and a haze rests in the air, I can barely see the water below.  \nBut I can still see the city lights from across the way.   \nThere are no cars on this bridge, all is quiet.  \nI can hear her breathing, her breaths visible in the air.  \nFive minutes.  \nShe looks at me: This is probably my favorite holiday.  \n“Why?”  \n*Because, you get to like, start over. Everything is new.*  \n“Everything is pretty much the same, I think.”  \n*No, it’s like a whole new, clean slate lies ahead of you.*  \nA clean slate sounds nice.  \nThree minutes.  \nShe lights up a cigarette, the flame casting shadows on her face.  \nThe smoke loops around us as we sit, loops and coils.  \nFuego.  \nI take a swig of Jameson, which I wrapped in a paper bag.  \nIt burns as it slides down my throat.  \nTwo minutes.  \n*Come on stand up here. It's almost time to listen!*  \nShe's perched on the ledge, reaches her hand down.  \nI hoist up.  \nA cold wind sends a shiver down my spine.  \n*This is the best part. It's so dead silent before it strikes twelve.*  \nOne minute.  \nWe don't speak, we barely move.  \nI just let the heaviness of the complete absence of sound weigh on me.  \nThe air seems lifeless.  \nBut she, she is so alive.  \nShe's bright, she's right there in front of me -  \nAll I want in the world.   \nThen I drop the ball, and tell her I love her.  \nShe looks at me.  \n*Can you not right now?*  \n\"Can I not what?\"  \n*Be so complicated and serious.*  \n\"But I do and I mean it.\"  \n*Well I don't love you Steph. I don't want to love you, or anyone. You're fucked up. I thought I made it clear, like, I'm not in this forever. You're always trying to push for something more.*\nI feel the blood in my veins freeze.  \nAnd then the banging and the clanging rang through the air.  \nMidnight.  \n\nI woke up on New Year's Day and that morning my apartment felt colder than normal. Obviously Winter wasn’t next to me when I crawled out of my slumber, and half of me expected to see her sleeping on the couch where I frequently found her the next morning after a drunken fight. The other half of me knew I'd never find her there again.\n\nThe next three nights I spent at the bar where I met her, thinking maybe I'd see her there. But then they found her body washed up on the river's shore, and three days after that they picked me up.\n\nThey say I choked her. They say I put my hands around her throat and must have squeezed until the iridescence was shaken right out of her. The forest of her eyes must have become like the universe then; vast, empty, lifeless. Winter melted away. When I let go I let her fall back, off the bridge and into the river. I sat on the ledge and thought of letting myself fall.\n\nFinish the bottle of Jameson.  \nGrow some balls.  \nLeaning a little forward now, glancing down into the fog below.  \nCan’t see her. Can’t even see the water.  \nNo balls.  \n\nThe banging and the clanging probably started dying down. I don't remember. And when all was silent again, I got into my car and drove the five minutes home drunk.\n\nAnd before I went to sleep, I flushed ‘Goldie the Third’ down the toilet.\n","source":"winter.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Winter\nauthor: Breanna Ransome\nlayout: article\nheaderimage: img/header-winter.jpg\naccenttext: “I feel like it’s a common comparison to say eyes are like the universe, but hers were like a forest; a mixture of earth tones like greens and browns.

I look like an uptight bitch.  \nIf I take it out is she going to notice?  \nThat'd be worse than looking like I just left the gym.  \nThen she'd be onto me being into her.  \nI have no clue if she'd be into being onto me.  \nI'm taking my hair out.  \n\nI threw everything associated with her out, even the shampoo that we shared – well I kept the conditioner, but it's not like she used it; her hair was so short. Utterly black and coarse like tulle, tufts of bangs sprouted from her forehead. I’d always brush them aside in the morning to venture into her hazel eyes. I feel like it’s a common comparison to say eyes are like the universe, but hers were like a forest; a mixture of earth tones like greens and browns. If you lie amidst the trees and look up, the light shines through the canopy of leaves in such a way that almost does justice to the iridescence in her eyes.\n\nShe's looking at me, I know it.  \nI should've kept my hair up.  \nShe knows.  \nAnother.  \nWhy’d I even come to the bar by myself?   \nOh yeah, because my friends chose the ex over me.  \nThe bartender keeps staring at my boobs, Christ.  \nThis guy’s a beef-head.  \nBum night. I just want to close my tab.   \nI’m not even tipping this guy.   \nHe probably drugged me, whatever.  \nSome buxom blonde plants herself on the stool next to me.  \nCompliments my hair.  \nAsks about my day.  \nOffers to buy me a drink.  \nShe seems sweet, and she’s stunning.  \nDeny offer.  \nI walk out and try to light a cigarette.  \nI barely smoke, whatever.   \nLighter’s out of fluid: click, click, nothing, shake, click, nothing.  \n*Fuego?*  \nTurn around, and there she is holding out a lighter…  \nLast thing I expected. But ok. Baby balls?  \n…With a pickle design printed on it.  \nCute.   \nAssuming that means she likes pickles.  \nWait, what? Fuck I was a cynical.   \nWho makes their lighter purchase specifically to advertise their sexual preference?  \n“Thanks…”  \n*Winter.*  \n“What?”  \nHa, that's my name.  \n“Your name is Winter?”  \n*Yeah, I like ‘Winnie’ better though. You?*  \n“I like ‘Winnie’ better, too.”  \n*No, your name…*  \n“Oh! Steph. So you like pickles?” – word vomit.  \nShe giggles at both my question and the agony on my face for having asked it.  \n*Only the kind that are green and come in a jar.*   \n\nAt least my apartment wouldn’t smell like weed anymore. She’d store some in my dresser for when she was over; I found a few nugs in the cat’s staple food bag once, whoever knows how they got there. It was one of those big ones from PetSmart that you buy to last you through the next ice age; I’ve been scooping away at the supply for what feels like a century.\n\nPassing a joint, we’d lie on the floor of my apartment on Sunday afternoons in our t-shirts and underwear like something you’d see in a music video: stereotypical lesbian-movie couple, bring in the Arctic Monkeys. We’d have what I thought at the time was deep conversation, but to her it was just high-talk.\n\n“Do you ever feel like something is totally bothering you, and you wish you knew what it was, but you sort of do and you’re just like unconsciously pretending that you don’t?”  \n *What’s bothering you?*  \n“My mind knows but it won’t tell me.”  \n*Then how do you know?*  \n“Instincts.”  \n*Thirsty?*  \n“No.”  \n*Hungry?*  \n“I’m not talking about a lack of basic human necessity that a dry mouth or grumbling stomach will tell me. Not those kind of instincts.”  \n*What kinds then?*  \n“The ones you don’t know about. The ones you haven’t the slightest clue about but you know somehow they’re there. ‘Cause if they weren’t, where would this thought I’m having even come from?”   \n*What’s the matter Steph? Why're you getting all mysterious on me? Lighten up.*  \n“I don't know I just feel like there's all types of things that I should talk about and I just can’t.”  \n*Tell me then, tell me a story.*  \n\nSo I told her about my mom and my dad. I told her about how they kicked me out when I was seventeen-years-old because they found out I liked girls. I told her about the long three years of silence between us until they finally accepted I wasn't going to change where I liked putting my mouth. I told her about how my brother would have his friends sleep over, and that they spied on me changing when I was only fourteen-years-old. I told her that his science partner Jimmy actually came into my room one of those nights and stuck his fingers in my underwear when I had pretended to be asleep, and that I told my parents but they brushed it off as normal “guy stuff.” I told her about how he did it five times after that. I told her about my hamster Charlie I had when I was six-years old, and that he never let me hold him, so one day I got so angry I snatched him out of his cage and squeezed him a little too hard. I told her about how when I was four-years old the priest at our church told me God wouldn’t love me if I didn’t sing loud enough for him to hear. I told her about how every girl I've ever been with has taken me for granted.  \n\n*Mm.*  \n“That's all you have to say?”  \n*What do you want me to say? You're being ‘bad vibes.’ Can't we just have fun?*  \n“Don't we always ‘just have fun.' Do you even take me seriously?”  \n*Why're you talking like this?*  \n“I don’t know, Winnie. Probs the weed.”  \nShe sits up, looking at me with her squinty, glassy eyes, and pouts with her bottom lip curling outward at me.  \n“Why the face?”  \nShe mocks me in a nasally voice.  \n*I dyan’t knyaow Winnie.

We scratched the tickets furiously with sticky pennies and when we lost all of them except for two ($5 total were the fruits of our labor), we drowned our poverty-stricken sorrows in whiskey. Since we couldn't afford to get into any glamorous shenanigans that weekend to celebrate, we walked the river and smoked a filtered joint.

Why.   \nWhere’s your boyfriend?  \n*“I’m gay.”*  \nOh.  \nYeah I’m not in the mood for that right now.   \nI’m ready to leave.   \nRachel pulls this shit all the time.  \nShe forces me to come to these clubs filled with a bunch of horny men.  \nDisappears for four hours, and comes back sweaty.  \nFresh off the dance floor.  \nThe ‘DJ,’ if that’s what you want to call him, is blasting some basic dance music.  \nI’m going to find her.  \nCheck the bathroom.  \nNope.  \nWalk the entire floor; wince each time the strobe flashes.  \n*Thump thump thump –*  \n*Cool music bro let’s bump our fists, yeah bro.*  \nSomeone just grabbed my ass.  \nNope.  \nMaybe I’ll bum a smoke.  \nNever mind, Rachel would kill me.  \nThe last time she saw me taking a drag she started crying.  \nActually yeah, I need a fucking cigarette.  \n\nRachel and I dated for two years, and this is what it came down to: a break-up that left me girlfriendless, friendless, depressed, and full of ugly anger. I thought for a long time about moving to a different state, and starting my life completely over. I probably should have. Scratch that – I definitely should have.   \n\nI can hear the repetitive *thump thump thumps* even from outside.   \nAnd there she is.  \nWearing some guy’s jacket.   \nLeaning up against the brick wall.  \nShe’s trashed.  \nShe can’t even keep both of her eyes open at the same time.   \nHis palms are pressed to the wall, arms caging her there.  \nCall her name.  \nNo response.  \nMarch over.  \nSpit out, “You cold Rachel?”  \n*He tells me to fuck off.*  \n“That’s my girlfriend, asshole.”  \n*Not tonight.*  \nGrab her, rip the jacket off.  \nThis dirtbag is approaching me, so I elbow him in his chest.  \nShe’s really cursing at me.  \nHow is she pissed at me right now?  \nI’m the one that’s allowed to be pissed.  \nShe slurs: *Boring dyke.*  \nI yank her away.  \nShe fights to free her wrist.  \n“You want to go? Fine.”  \nLaunch her toward the wall.  \nShe smacks her skull on the brick.  \nOut cold.  \n\nShe told everyone I attacked her. She told everyone I was a fucking violent craze-o. She told everyone she wasn’t doing anything wrong. All of our mutual friends shunned me. They stopped answering my calls. They DeFriended me on Facebook. I actually saw Emily in ShopRite a handful of times, and she made every effort to stay as far away from me as possible. When we did lock eyes, she gave me an injuring look of disgust. When I first saw Winter in the bar, I thought twice about her because she was there with three guy friends. But like I said before, they were pretty gay-looking. Well, non-threatening. I’m not even really that jealous of a person, I don’t think. I just didn’t want a repeat of Rachel-the-lesbian-who’s-not-really-a-lesbian show.\n\nRachel pushed me to my limit. There she was wearing some sketchy man’s jacket, pinned up against a sketchy wall at one in the morning outside of some sketchy bar that the sketchy wall belonged to, looking like she had just washed down ten sketchy drinks. So she got a restraining order. Our friends chose her over me. And that was it. After two years.\n\nThe ball drops in ten minutes.   \nIt took us only about five to drive here.  \nWinter insisted we drive.  \nHappy New Year.   \nShe tells me that she comes to this spot every year.   \nShe loves to listen to the faint echo of pots and pans clanging.  \nShe says the sounds bounce off the buildings and stretch across the water.   \nThe moon’s shrouded and a haze rests in the air, I can barely see the water below.  \nBut I can still see the city lights from across the way.   \nThere are no cars on this bridge, all is quiet.  \nI can hear her breathing, her breaths visible in the air.  \nFive minutes.  \nShe looks at me: This is probably my favorite holiday.  \n“Why?”  \n*Because, you get to like, start over. Everything is new.*  \n“Everything is pretty much the same, I think.”  \n*No, it’s like a whole new, clean slate lies ahead of you.*  \nA clean slate sounds nice.  \nThree minutes.  \nShe lights up a cigarette, the flame casting shadows on her face.  \nThe smoke loops around us as we sit, loops and coils.  \nFuego.  \nI take a swig of Jameson, which I wrapped in a paper bag.  \nIt burns as it slides down my throat.  \nTwo minutes.  \n*Come on stand up here. It's almost time to listen!*  \nShe's perched on the ledge, reaches her hand down.  \nI hoist up.  \nA cold wind sends a shiver down my spine.  \n*This is the best part. It's so dead silent before it strikes twelve.*  \nOne minute.  \nWe don't speak, we barely move.  \nI just let the heaviness of the complete absence of sound weigh on me.  \nThe air seems lifeless.  \nBut she, she is so alive.  \nShe's bright, she's right there in front of me -  \nAll I want in the world.   \nThen I drop the ball, and tell her I love her.  \nShe looks at me.  \n*Can you not right now?*  \n\"Can I not what?\"  \n*Be so complicated and serious.*  \n\"But I do and I mean it.\"  \n*Well I don't love you Steph. I don't want to love you, or anyone. You're fucked up. I thought I made it clear, like, I'm not in this forever. You're always trying to push for something more.*\nI feel the blood in my veins freeze.  \nAnd then the banging and the clanging rang through the air.  \nMidnight.  \n\nI woke up on New Year's Day and that morning my apartment felt colder than normal. Obviously Winter wasn’t next to me when I crawled out of my slumber, and half of me expected to see her sleeping on the couch where I frequently found her the next morning after a drunken fight. The other half of me knew I'd never find her there again.\n\nThe next three nights I spent at the bar where I met her, thinking maybe I'd see her there. But then they found her body washed up on the river's shore, and three days after that they picked me up.\n\nThey say I choked her. They say I put my hands around her throat and must have squeezed until the iridescence was shaken right out of her. The forest of her eyes must have become like the universe then; vast, empty, lifeless. Winter melted away. When I let go I let her fall back, off the bridge and into the river. I sat on the ledge and thought of letting myself fall.\n\nFinish the bottle of Jameson.  \nGrow some balls.  \nLeaning a little forward now, glancing down into the fog below.  \nCan’t see her. Can’t even see the water.  \nNo balls.  \n\nThe banging and the clanging probably started dying down. I don't remember. And when all was silent again, I got into my car and drove the five minutes home drunk.\n\nAnd before I went to sleep, I flushed ‘Goldie the Third’ down the toilet.\n","date":"2017-04-26T15:22:14.000Z","updated":"2017-04-26T15:22:14.000Z","path":"winter.html","comments":1,"_id":"cj2292wf8000fqorcrbgetq3p","content":"<p>Winter is only my favorite season when I’m safe indoors; frosty vignettes on big bay windows; thick socks and oversized sweaters encapsulate my toes and shoulders; the heat from my mug warms my hands and emits a steam that hugs my runny nose.</p>\n<p>Winter is only my favorite season, when I’m safe in love; someone to shiver with in the car, clutching each other’s hands while we wait for the engine to warm up; someone to put my towel in the dryer when she hears me hop in the shower after I’ve stripped off my snow-shoveling clothes; someone to braid my hair while I peruse my basic cable for <em>Nightmare Before Christmas</em> (we were both pretty sure it was on channel 34 but found it 12 channels and two French braids later).</p>\n<p>Winter was always my favorite season, until she froze me over.</p>\n<p>I met her at a bar when I was 24-years-old.</p>\n<p>Gin and tonic.<br>She’s at a table with her friends, three guys.<br>All pretty flamboyant.<br>Another drink.<br>It’s been about fifteen minutes since I last glanced back to see her.<br>I’ve resolved to stop looking like a lonely stalker.<br>Then she laughs.<br>So I grow some balls and get up from the bar stool.<br>Hold on, shot of fireball.<br>Bigger balls.<br>Walk toward her table but chicken out.<br>No balls.<br>Never mind.<br>Fuck I look stupid.<br>Go to the bathroom, Steph.<br>Okay, so I go to the bathroom.<br>I look sober but I feel like a drunken idiot.<br>I need to re-do this ponytail.<br>Why is my hair even up?

Utterly black and coarse like tulle, tufts of bangs sprouted from her forehead. I’d always brush them aside in the morning to venture into her hazel eyes. I feel like it’s a common comparison to say eyes are like the universe, but hers were like a forest; a mixture of earth tones like greens and browns. If you lie amidst the trees and look up, the light shines through the canopy of leaves in such a way that almost does justice to the iridescence in her eyes.</p>\n<p>She’s looking at me, I know it.<br>I should’ve kept my hair up.<br>She knows.<br>Another.<br>Why’d I even come to the bar by myself?<br>Oh yeah, because my friends chose the ex over me.<br>The bartender keeps staring at my boobs, Christ.<br>This guy’s a beef-head.<br>Bum night.

But ok. Baby balls?<br>…With a pickle design printed on it.<br>Cute.<br>Assuming that means she likes pickles.<br>Wait, what? Fuck I was a cynical.<br>Who makes their lighter purchase specifically to advertise their sexual preference?<br>“Thanks…”<br><em>Winter.</em><br>“What?”<br>Ha, that’s my name.<br>“Your name is Winter?”<br><em>Yeah, I like ‘Winnie’ better though. You?</em><br>“I like ‘Winnie’ better, too.”<br><em>No, your name…</em><br>“Oh! Steph. So you like pickles?” – word vomit.<br>She giggles at both my question and the agony on my face for having asked it.<br><em>Only the kind that are green and come in a jar.</em>   </p>\n<p>At least my apartment wouldn’t smell like weed anymore. She’d store some in my dresser for when she was over; I found a few nugs in the cat’s staple food bag once, whoever knows how they got there. It was one of those big ones from PetSmart that you buy to last you through the next ice age; I’ve been scooping away at the supply for what feels like a century.</p>\n<p>Passing a joint, we’d lie on the floor of my apartment on Sunday afternoons in our t-shirts and underwear like something you’d see in a music video: stereotypical lesbian-movie couple, bring in the Arctic Monkeys. We’d have what I thought at the time was deep conversation, but to her it was just high-talk.</p>\n<p>“Do you ever feel like something is totally bothering you, and you wish you knew what it was, but you sort of do and you’re just like unconsciously pretending that you don’t?”<br> <em>What’s bothering you?</em><br>“My mind knows but it won’t tell me.”<br><em>Then how do you know?</em><br>“Instincts.”<br><em>Thirsty?</em><br>“No.”<br><em>Hungry?</em><br>“I’m not talking about a lack of basic human necessity that a dry mouth or grumbling stomach will tell me. Not those kind of instincts.”<br><em>What kinds then?</em><br>“The ones you don’t know about. The ones you haven’t the slightest clue about but you know somehow they’re there. ‘Cause if they weren’t, where would this thought I’m having even come from?”<br><em>What’s the matter Steph? Why’re you getting all mysterious on me? Lighten up.</em><br>“I don’t know I just feel like there’s all types of things that I should talk about and I just can’t.”<br><em>Tell me then, tell me a story.</em>  </p>\n<p>So I told her about my mom and my dad. I told her about how they kicked me out when I was seventeen-years-old because they found out I liked girls. I told her about the long three years of silence between us until they finally accepted I wasn’t going to change where I liked putting my mouth. I told her about how my brother would have his friends sleep over, and that they spied on me changing when I was only fourteen-years-old. I told her that his science partner Jimmy actually came into my room one of those nights and stuck his fingers in my underwear when I had pretended to be asleep, and that I told my parents but they brushed it off as normal “guy stuff.” I told her about how he did it five times after that. I told her about my hamster Charlie I had when I was six-years old, and that he never let me hold him, so one day I got so angry I snatched him out of his cage and squeezed him a little too hard. I told her about how when I was four-years old the priest at our church told me God wouldn’t love me if I didn’t sing loud enough for him to hear. I told her about how every girl I’ve ever been with has taken me for granted.  </p>\n<p><em>Mm.</em><br>“That’s all you have to say?”<br><em>What do you want me to say? You’re being ‘bad vibes.’ Can’t we just have fun?</em><br>“Don’t we always ‘just have fun.’ Do you even take me seriously?”<br><em>Why’re you talking like this?</em><br>“I don’t know, Winnie. Probs the weed.”<br>She sits up, looking at me with her squinty, glassy eyes, and pouts with her bottom lip curling outward at me.<br>“Why the face?”<br>She mocks me in a nasally voice.<br><em>I dyan’t knyaow Winnie. Prabs tha wee-eed.</em><br>She explodes in laughter, shoots up from the rug like a missile, and let’s herself crash on top of me.   </p>\n<p>Making fun of me was always something she was good at. I miss those little digs she’d squeeze in. She was good at filling in the spaces – gaps in conversation, the empty drawers in my dresser with her spare clothes, the fish bowl when Goldie would belly up. She didn’t think I’d notice, but she actually replaced him two times that I’m sure of. I’d humor her by making little comments: “Goldie looks a little bigger today, maybe I’m over-feeding him.”   </p>\n<p>For my birthday she snagged me a booklet of lottery tickets and a bottle of Jim Beam. We scratched the tickets furiously with sticky pennies and when we lost all of them except for two ($5 total were the fruits of our labor), we drowned our poverty-stricken sorrows in whiskey. Since we couldn’t afford to get into any glamorous shenanigans that weekend to celebrate, we walked the river and smoked a filtered joint. Every time we saw a daisy she’s snatch it up and present it like it was the royal scepter: I picked this for you, milady.   </p>\n<p>For Fourth of July, Winter and I took a bunch of IPAs and laid out a blanket on a hill near the local high school to watch the fireworks. I forgot to bring the bottle opener; I could picture it sitting in the utensil drawer mixed in with the assortment of plastic knives and sporks I’d pocket from fast-food restaurants so I wouldn’t have to do as many dishes. In its absence, Winter brought out her lighter and showed me a trick to get the caps off. Apparently the lighter had to be positioned in this very specific way in order to get the right leverage, and after three failures I decided I didn’t have the knack for it. Plus, why would I need to learn if she’d always be around with her handy technique.</p>\n<p>For Thanksgiving, we ordered out from Boston Market and snagged a box of wine. We took all the food out of the plastic containers and set it up on my dining room table, lit candles, and used real silverware and the good china, Winter called it. Before we ate, she insisted we say what we were thankful for. She began:</p>\n<p><em>I am thankful for this chicken that has been rotisserie-d.<br>For the good china.<br>For the dishwasher.<br>I’m thankful for my homie Steph.<br>‘Cause she’s always there for me.<br>a—and, for dessert.<br>Which is also Steph.</em><br>Winks, laughs, launches a spoonful of mashed potatoes at me.</p>\n<p>So desert came and went and we passed out at 9 p.m.   </p>\n<p>And so it was finally winter; snow layered the ground, frosted the windows, iced-over the roads. We’d gotten to Wawa after driving four miles per hour so Winnie could get a hot chocolate. I asked her if she liked winter, “like, the season.” She said no because it stole her thunder, and how dare winter try to show her up like that. Mother nature’s got nothing on me. I chuckled like I usually did at her sassy remarks, and she smiled mischievously at me like she always did after delivering. I followed up my first question by inviting her to my family’s for dinner. She was really troubled by that, I remember her face twisting up into a reluctant grimace and her standing outside my passenger door craning her neck into the car.</p>\n<p><em>I’d rather not.</em><br>Blank stare.<br><em>I don’t think so, Steph.</em><br>“Well—”<br><em>Why would I do that?</em><br>This time it’s her face that has the blank stare.<br>“Maybe because we’ve been fucking for six months.”<br><em>What’s that have to do with literally anything, Steph.</em><br>I feel like I’m choking up, like my neck is swelling.<br>My body goes into high alert.<br>Like a bunch of bells and whistles and sirens screeching in my head.<br>That familiar wave of rejection engulfs me.<br>Swallows me whole in its heat.<br>This isn’t something I’m supposed to feel with her.<br>This isn’t what this is. This isn’t what this is supposed to be.<br>What? “What is this supposed to be?”<br><em>It’s supposed to be nothing. It’s supposed to be whatever it wants to be.</em><br>“You’re the one specifying it’s supposed to be something at all.”<br><em>No you are, by asking me to come to your family thing.</em><br>“Why wouldn’t I?”<br><em>But why would you?</em><br>She slams the car door.<br>I feel like we’re at the furthest corners of the universe from each other.<br>All alone on my side.<br>All alone in my Hyundai, my stupid vehicular bubble.<br>She storms into the Wawa.<br>And I scream at the top of my lungs.  </p>\n<p>This girl comes into my life one night at a bar where I’m soaking up my despair for the three months after my last break-up, and gives me a certain happiness I’ve never felt before and a hope that this was the one, this time was different, only to rip that happiness and that hope right out from under me. Winnie approached me at the bar; she sparked a fire in me, only to douse it. I texted her two days later to say sorry and that I should’ve known she wouldn’t want to come to some “corny dinner, my bad. my parents asked me to bring some1, i shouldnt have let them pressure me.” Her response: “its cool homie. wanna go ride bikes or something?” We didn’t talk about it again, and for the next week and through the holiday we went on as we normally did, even though it squeezed my insides into knots, burning like brimstone.</p>\n<p>So who’s the ex and why’d she leave? Rachel. Grade A bitch. Queen of melodrama. She wasn’t your typical looking-lesbian, either. She was hot. Like, really hot. She had long brunette hair always set in soft, loose curls. Her skin was smooth like she lathered herself in butter, smooth and incredibly tan (a good olive tan, too, not that orange spray shit). Her waist was my favorite thing about her, cinched like a corset that swooped outward into hips you could place a glass of water on (at least they seemed that way in comparison to mine – I’m built like a box, like a twelve-year-old boy with a box for a torso). She woke up an hour earlier than she had to before work each morning to perfect her hair and makeup. She wore dresses and skirts, push-up bras and thongs. I don’t even remember the last time I wore a bra. Naturally, when we’d go out together, guys were always all over her, assuming that I was just the ugly best friend. Rach would try so hard to dress me up, <em>take out your ponytail, don’t wear those jogger pants, put this blouse on, try this lipstick</em> et cetera, et cetera. I’d get pretty pissed off because, not only was she trying to change me, but she thought that picking up guys at the bar was some kind of game and she wanted me to join her.</p>\n<p>So I’d say the break-up was entirely her fault.  </p>\n<p>I’d rather sit at a dive-bar and order some beers.<br>Grab some quesadillas.<br>But no, I’m sitting here at ‘Rumor.’<br>I hate coming out to places like this.<br>12:58am.

Utterly black and coarse like tulle, tufts of bangs sprouted from her forehead. I’d always brush them aside in the morning to venture into her hazel eyes. I feel like it’s a common comparison to say eyes are like the universe, but hers were like a forest; a mixture of earth tones like greens and browns. If you lie amidst the trees and look up, the light shines through the canopy of leaves in such a way that almost does justice to the iridescence in her eyes.</p>\n<p>She’s looking at me, I know it.<br>I should’ve kept my hair up.<br>She knows.<br>Another.<br>Why’d I even come to the bar by myself?<br>Oh yeah, because my friends chose the ex over me.<br>The bartender keeps staring at my boobs, Christ.<br>This guy’s a beef-head.<br>Bum night.

So you like pickles?” – word vomit.<br>She giggles at both my question and the agony on my face for having asked it.<br><em>Only the kind that are green and come in a jar.</em>   </p>\n<p>At least my apartment wouldn’t smell like weed anymore. She’d store some in my dresser for when she was over; I found a few nugs in the cat’s staple food bag once, whoever knows how they got there. It was one of those big ones from PetSmart that you buy to last you through the next ice age; I’ve been scooping away at the supply for what feels like a century.</p>\n<p>Passing a joint, we’d lie on the floor of my apartment on Sunday afternoons in our t-shirts and underwear like something you’d see in a music video: stereotypical lesbian-movie couple, bring in the Arctic Monkeys. We’d have what I thought at the time was deep conversation, but to her it was just high-talk.</p>\n<p>“Do you ever feel like something is totally bothering you, and you wish you knew what it was, but you sort of do and you’re just like unconsciously pretending that you don’t?”<br> <em>What’s bothering you?</em><br>“My mind knows but it won’t tell me.”<br><em>Then how do you know?</em><br>“Instincts.”<br><em>Thirsty?</em><br>“No.”<br><em>Hungry?</em><br>“I’m not talking about a lack of basic human necessity that a dry mouth or grumbling stomach will tell me. Not those kind of instincts.”<br><em>What kinds then?</em><br>“The ones you don’t know about. The ones you haven’t the slightest clue about but you know somehow they’re there. ‘Cause if they weren’t, where would this thought I’m having even come from?”<br><em>What’s the matter Steph? Why’re you getting all mysterious on me? Lighten up.</em><br>“I don’t know I just feel like there’s all types of things that I should talk about and I just can’t.”<br><em>Tell me then, tell me a story.</em>  </p>\n<p>So I told her about my mom and my dad. I told her about how they kicked me out when I was seventeen-years-old because they found out I liked girls. I told her about the long three years of silence between us until they finally accepted I wasn’t going to change where I liked putting my mouth. I told her about how my brother would have his friends sleep over, and that they spied on me changing when I was only fourteen-years-old. I told her that his science partner Jimmy actually came into my room one of those nights and stuck his fingers in my underwear when I had pretended to be asleep, and that I told my parents but they brushed it off as normal “guy stuff.” I told her about how he did it five times after that. I told her about my hamster Charlie I had when I was six-years old, and that he never let me hold him, so one day I got so angry I snatched him out of his cage and squeezed him a little too hard. I told her about how when I was four-years old the priest at our church told me God wouldn’t love me if I didn’t sing loud enough for him to hear. I told her about how every girl I’ve ever been with has taken me for granted.  </p>\n<p><em>Mm.</em><br>“That’s all you have to say?”<br><em>What do you want me to say? You’re being ‘bad vibes.’ Can’t we just have fun?</em><br>“Don’t we always ‘just have fun.’ Do you even take me seriously?”<br><em>Why’re you talking like this?</em><br>“I don’t know, Winnie. Probs the weed.”<br>She sits up, looking at me with her squinty, glassy eyes, and pouts with her bottom lip curling outward at me.<br>“Why the face?”<br>She mocks me in a nasally voice.<br><em>I dyan’t knyaow Winnie. Prabs tha wee-eed.</em><br>She explodes in laughter, shoots up from the rug like a missile, and let’s herself crash on top of me.   </p>\n<p>Making fun of me was always something she was good at. I miss those little digs she’d squeeze in. She was good at filling in the spaces – gaps in conversation, the empty drawers in my dresser with her spare clothes, the fish bowl when Goldie would belly up. She didn’t think I’d notice, but she actually replaced him two times that I’m sure of. I’d humor her by making little comments: “Goldie looks a little bigger today, maybe I’m over-feeding him.”   </p>\n<p>For my birthday she snagged me a booklet of lottery tickets and a bottle of Jim Beam. We scratched the tickets furiously with sticky pennies and when we lost all of them except for two ($5 total were the fruits of our labor), we drowned our poverty-stricken sorrows in whiskey. Since we couldn’t afford to get into any glamorous shenanigans that weekend to celebrate, we walked the river and smoked a filtered joint. Every time we saw a daisy she’s snatch it up and present it like it was the royal scepter: I picked this for you, milady.   </p>\n<p>For Fourth of July, Winter and I took a bunch of IPAs and laid out a blanket on a hill near the local high school to watch the fireworks. I forgot to bring the bottle opener; I could picture it sitting in the utensil drawer mixed in with the assortment of plastic knives and sporks I’d pocket from fast-food restaurants so I wouldn’t have to do as many dishes. In its absence, Winter brought out her lighter and showed me a trick to get the caps off. Apparently the lighter had to be positioned in this very specific way in order to get the right leverage, and after three failures I decided I didn’t have the knack for it. Plus, why would I need to learn if she’d always be around with her handy technique.</p>\n<p>For Thanksgiving, we ordered out from Boston Market and snagged a box of wine. We took all the food out of the plastic containers and set it up on my dining room table, lit candles, and used real silverware and the good china, Winter called it. Before we ate, she insisted we say what we were thankful for. She began:</p>\n<p><em>I am thankful for this chicken that has been rotisserie-d.<br>For the good china.<br>For the dishwasher.<br>I’m thankful for my homie Steph.<br>‘Cause she’s always there for me.<br>a—and, for dessert.<br>Which is also Steph.</em><br>Winks, laughs, launches a spoonful of mashed potatoes at me.</p>\n<p>So desert came and went and we passed out at 9 p.m.   </p>\n<p>And so it was finally winter; snow layered the ground, frosted the windows, iced-over the roads. We’d gotten to Wawa after driving four miles per hour so Winnie could get a hot chocolate. I asked her if she liked winter, “like, the season.” She said no because it stole her thunder, and how dare winter try to show her up like that. Mother nature’s got nothing on me. I chuckled like I usually did at her sassy remarks, and she smiled mischievously at me like she always did after delivering. I followed up my first question by inviting her to my family’s for dinner. She was really troubled by that, I remember her face twisting up into a reluctant grimace and her standing outside my passenger door craning her neck into the car.</p>\n<p><em>I’d rather not.</em><br>Blank stare.<br><em>I don’t think so, Steph.</em><br>“Well—”<br><em>Why would I do that?</em><br>This time it’s her face that has the blank stare.<br>“Maybe because we’ve been fucking for six months.”<br><em>What’s that have to do with literally anything, Steph.</em><br>I feel like I’m choking up, like my neck is swelling.<br>My body goes into high alert.<br>Like a bunch of bells and whistles and sirens screeching in my head.<br>That familiar wave of rejection engulfs me.<br>Swallows me whole in its heat.<br>This isn’t something I’m supposed to feel with her.<br>This isn’t what this is. This isn’t what this is supposed to be.<br>What? “What is this supposed to be?”<br><em>It’s supposed to be nothing. It’s supposed to be whatever it wants to be.</em><br>“You’re the one specifying it’s supposed to be something at all.”<br><em>No you are, by asking me to come to your family thing.</em><br>“Why wouldn’t I?”<br><em>But why would you?</em><br>She slams the car door.<br>I feel like we’re at the furthest corners of the universe from each other.<br>All alone on my side.<br>All alone in my Hyundai, my stupid vehicular bubble.<br>She storms into the Wawa.<br>And I scream at the top of my lungs.  </p>\n<p>This girl comes into my life one night at a bar where I’m soaking up my despair for the three months after my last break-up, and gives me a certain happiness I’ve never felt before and a hope that this was the one, this time was different, only to rip that happiness and that hope right out from under me. Winnie approached me at the bar; she sparked a fire in me, only to douse it. I texted her two days later to say sorry and that I should’ve known she wouldn’t want to come to some “corny dinner, my bad. my parents asked me to bring some1, i shouldnt have let them pressure me.” Her response: “its cool homie. wanna go ride bikes or something?” We didn’t talk about it again, and for the next week and through the holiday we went on as we normally did, even though it squeezed my insides into knots, burning like brimstone.</p>\n<p>So who’s the ex and why’d she leave? Rachel. Grade A bitch. Queen of melodrama. She wasn’t your typical looking-lesbian, either. She was hot. Like, really hot. She had long brunette hair always set in soft, loose curls. Her skin was smooth like she lathered herself in butter, smooth and incredibly tan (a good olive tan, too, not that orange spray shit). Her waist was my favorite thing about her, cinched like a corset that swooped outward into hips you could place a glass of water on (at least they seemed that way in comparison to mine – I’m built like a box, like a twelve-year-old boy with a box for a torso). She woke up an hour earlier than she had to before work each morning to perfect her hair and makeup. She wore dresses and skirts, push-up bras and thongs. I don’t even remember the last time I wore a bra. Naturally, when we’d go out together, guys were always all over her, assuming that I was just the ugly best friend. Rach would try so hard to dress me up, <em>take out your ponytail, don’t wear those jogger pants, put this blouse on, try this lipstick</em> et cetera, et cetera. I’d get pretty pissed off because, not only was she trying to change me, but she thought that picking up guys at the bar was some kind of game and she wanted me to join her.</p>\n<p>So I’d say the break-up was entirely her fault.  </p>\n<p>I’d rather sit at a dive-bar and order some beers.<br>Grab some quesadillas.<br>But no, I’m sitting here at ‘Rumor.’<br>I hate coming out to places like this.<br>12:58am. Great. This place is open for another hour.<br>When Rachel drags me out like this, she’s never ready to leave until last call.<br>I haven’t even seen her in like 20 minutes.<br>Force a conversation with the bartender.<br>He’s trying to hit on me. Why.<br>Where’s your boyfriend?<br><em>“I’m gay.”</em><br>Oh.<br>Yeah I’m not in the mood for that right now.<br>I’m ready to leave.<br>Rachel pulls this shit all the time.<br>She forces me to come to these clubs filled with a bunch of horny men.<br>Disappears for four hours, and comes back sweaty.<br>Fresh off the dance floor.<br>The ‘DJ,’ if that’s what you want to call him, is blasting some basic dance music.<br>I’m going to find her.<br>Check the bathroom.<br>Nope.<br>Walk the entire floor; wince each time the strobe flashes.<br><em>Thump thump thump –</em><br><em>Cool music bro let’s bump our fists, yeah bro.</em><br>Someone just grabbed my ass.<br>Nope.<br>Maybe I’ll bum a smoke.<br>Never mind, Rachel would kill me.<br>The last time she saw me taking a drag she started crying.<br>Actually yeah, I need a fucking cigarette.  </p>\n<p>Rachel and I dated for two years, and this is what it came down to: a break-up that left me girlfriendless, friendless, depressed, and full of ugly anger. I thought for a long time about moving to a different state, and starting my life completely over. I probably should have. Scratch that – I definitely should have.   </p>\n<p>I can hear the repetitive <em>thump thump thumps</em> even from outside.<br>And there she is.<br>Wearing some guy’s jacket.<br>Leaning up against the brick wall.<br>She’s trashed.<br>She can’t even keep both of her eyes open at the same time.<br>His palms are pressed to the wall, arms caging her there.<br>Call her name.<br>No response.<br>March over.<br>Spit out, “You cold Rachel?”<br><em>He tells me to fuck off.</em><br>“That’s my girlfriend, asshole.”<br><em>Not tonight.</em><br>Grab her, rip the jacket off.<br>This dirtbag is approaching me, so I elbow him in his chest.<br>She’s really cursing at me.<br>How is she pissed at me right now?<br>I’m the one that’s allowed to be pissed.<br>She slurs: <em>Boring dyke.</em><br>I yank her away.<br>She fights to free her wrist.<br>“You want to go? Fine.”<br>Launch her toward the wall.<br>She smacks her skull on the brick.<br>Out cold.  </p>\n<p>She told everyone I attacked her. She told everyone I was a fucking violent craze-o. She told everyone she wasn’t doing anything wrong. All of our mutual friends shunned me. They stopped answering my calls. They DeFriended me on Facebook. I actually saw Emily in ShopRite a handful of times, and she made every effort to stay as far away from me as possible. When we did lock eyes, she gave me an injuring look of disgust. When I first saw Winter in the bar, I thought twice about her because she was there with three guy friends. But like I said before, they were pretty gay-looking. Well, non-threatening. I’m not even really that jealous of a person, I don’t think. I just didn’t want a repeat of Rachel-the-lesbian-who’s-not-really-a-lesbian show.</p>\n<p>Rachel pushed me to my limit. There she was wearing some sketchy man’s jacket, pinned up against a sketchy wall at one in the morning outside of some sketchy bar that the sketchy wall belonged to, looking like she had just washed down ten sketchy drinks. So she got a restraining order. Our friends chose her over me. And that was it. After two years.</p>\n<p>The ball drops in ten minutes.<br>It took us only about five to drive here.<br>Winter insisted we drive.<br>Happy New Year.<br>She tells me that she comes to this spot every year.<br>She loves to listen to the faint echo of pots and pans clanging.<br>She says the sounds bounce off the buildings and stretch across the water.<br>The moon’s shrouded and a haze rests in the air, I can barely see the water below.<br>But I can still see the city lights from across the way.<br>There are no cars on this bridge, all is quiet.<br>I can hear her breathing, her breaths visible in the air.<br>Five minutes.<br>She looks at me: This is probably my favorite holiday.<br>“Why?”<br><em>Because, you get to like, start over. Everything is new.</em><br>“Everything is pretty much the same, I think.”<br><em>No, it’s like a whole new, clean slate lies ahead of you.</em><br>A clean slate sounds nice.<br>Three minutes.<br>She lights up a cigarette, the flame casting shadows on her face.<br>The smoke loops around us as we sit, loops and coils.<br>Fuego.<br>I take a swig of Jameson, which I wrapped in a paper bag.<br>It burns as it slides down my throat.<br>Two minutes.<br><em>Come on stand up here. It’s almost time to listen!</em><br>She’s perched on the ledge, reaches her hand down.<br>I hoist up.<br>A cold wind sends a shiver down my spine.<br><em>This is the best part. It’s so dead silent before it strikes twelve.</em><br>One minute.<br>We don’t speak, we barely move.<br>I just let the heaviness of the complete absence of sound weigh on me.<br>The air seems lifeless.<br>But she, she is so alive.<br>She’s bright, she’s right there in front of me -<br>All I want in the world.<br>Then I drop the ball, and tell her I love her.<br>She looks at me.<br><em>Can you not right now?</em><br>“Can I not what?”<br><em>Be so complicated and serious.</em><br>“But I do and I mean it.”<br><em>Well I don’t love you Steph. I don’t want to love you, or anyone. You’re fucked up. I thought I made it clear, like, I’m not in this forever. You’re always trying to push for something more.</em><br>I feel the blood in my veins freeze.<br>And then the banging and the clanging rang through the air.<br>Midnight.  </p>\n<p>I woke up on New Year’s Day and that morning my apartment felt colder than normal. Obviously Winter wasn’t next to me when I crawled out of my slumber, and half of me expected to see her sleeping on the couch where I frequently found her the next morning after a drunken fight. The other half of me knew I’d never find her there again.</p>\n<p>The next three nights I spent at the bar where I met her, thinking maybe I’d see her there. But then they found her body washed up on the river’s shore, and three days after that they picked me up.</p>\n<p>They say I choked her. They say I put my hands around her throat and must have squeezed until the iridescence was shaken right out of her. The forest of her eyes must have become like the universe then; vast, empty, lifeless. Winter melted away. When I let go I let her fall back, off the bridge and into the river. I sat on the ledge and thought of letting myself fall.</p>\n<p>Finish the bottle of Jameson.<br>Grow some balls.<br>Leaning a little forward now, glancing down into the fog below.<br>Can’t see her. Can’t even see the water.<br>No balls.  </p>\n<p>The banging and the clanging probably started dying down. I don’t remember. And when all was silent again, I got into my car and drove the five minutes home drunk.</p>\n<p>And before I went to sleep, I flushed ‘Goldie the Third’ down the toilet.</p>\n"},{"title":"That Perfect Girl is Gone&#58; A Look at Disney Females&rsquo; Evolution","author":"John Patouhas","layout":"article","headerimage":"img/header-thatperfectgirlisgone.jpg","accenttext":"This twist, I believe, serves to show the fault of the “love at first sight” motif that is all too common in fairy tales.","accentimage":"img/accent-image-perfectgirl.jpg","_content":"From iconic golden-jeweled tiaras and floor length ball gowns to magic spells and poisonous apples, the female royalty of the Disney Empire has and continues to enthrall people across generations and age groups. The princesses have littered young children's bedrooms, theme parks and films for nearly a century and in turn have become a large topic of debate and observation. These conversations vary from praise to criticism; the focus has been on the ever-changing portrayal of female independence, strength and sexuality throughout the years. Snow White from the film *Snow White and the Seven Dwarves* represents a positive portrayal of female repression and restriction, while Pocahontas from the film *Pocahontas* represents a positive portrayal of female freedom. Elsa from the film *Frozen* acts as a bridge between these two, looking to exhibit the dangers of female restrictions such as Snow White and the celebration of female liberation and freedom such as Pocahontas, which paints her as a three-dimensional heroine exhibiting this progression. However I look to argue that, despite popular opinions and social media reactions to *Frozen*, Elsa is definitely not the first female heroine to exhibit independence, a healthy sexual expression or strength. I would like to show how there has been a gradual linear progression of these aspects all along that has increasingly improved over time, rather than overnight. I look to make this argument by examining the expression of female sexuality and independence and how it has progressed over time in different ways through three Disney heroines.\n\nOur three heroines can be seen as examples of how females presented different stages of independence and sexual expression in film. Nearly eighty years ago we were introduced to the beautiful and innocent, yet passive Snow White. Displaying the beauty ideals of a young female and the part which she plays in society in her film, Snow White can be looked at as an example of how females were expected to be behave. Flash forward nearly fifty-seven years and we’re introduced to an entirely different type of heroine; the Native American Pocahontas proves to show a different side of what a female character can possibly be. An independent, free-spirited daydreamer, Pocahontas plays a much more active role in her life and is portrayed as a liberated and powerful character. In an icy blast we find ourselves in present day where just less than two years ago we were introduced to the Snow Queen of Arendelle. We see this character go from the villain of the original tale to a complex anti-hero of the final film. Not only does Elsa offer us a celebration of an independent and powerful female character, but she also the shows downfall of restricting such strengths.\n\nWhen we are discussing the roles a female character plays in relation to the stereotypical gender roles and the portrayal of her independence the female’s expression of sexuality is a pivotal plot point. In family films like these we usually see sexuality as an underlying theme, being expressed through various symbols and subtle characterizations. The expression of female sexuality has gone through many different steps to get to where we are today. Snow White is presented as the idealized patriarchal figure of what women should emulate: Snow White is non-sexual, conservative, naïve, innocent and passive. Her character design includes a long dress, a modest neckline, and hair done-up tightly while her body language can be described as modest, restricted and proper. All of these physical traits can easily play into the ideal of how women “should” think and behave. An important symbol in the film for sexuality is the apple. With the allusion to the temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden, Snow White's apple symbolizes a sexual and deadly temptation, sending an underlying message of the “danger” of a female expressing her “sinful” sexuality. We see this apple offered by the only other female character. This further paints the image that all sin arises from the temptation of females (those who don’t emulate Snow White's brand of innocence). Snow White effectively “dies” from even one taste of this “sin” only to be rescued by a man. I believe that this not only places Snow White in a helpless role, but also sends a message that sexuality is only appropriate or redeemable when it’s a male perpetrating the action.\n\nIf we’re to compare Snow White to Pocahontas, it’s almost the complete opposite. Looking at character design we see Pocahontas as having a more curvy or sexualized image, with a short dress, an off-the-shoulder neckline, all completed with her hair down. Hair can act as a symbol for sexuality or expressive freedom. Specifically in that Snow White's uptight, structured and modest hair style offers a glimpse into her conservative role concerning sexuality while Pocahontas's raven hair frequently seen flowing in the wind can be looked at as more sexually liberated. Pocahontas also sports a tattoo, which would be hard to imagine on Snow White. Tattoos in literature are often symbols of individuality or freedom of expression. This sense of freedom is very important in her characterization. “Pocahontas has her mother's spirit, she goes wherever the wind takes her” are the first words spoken of her. Her character is also frequently seen running and jumping throughout the film, a clear contrast from Snow White's reserved body language. This introduction to her character paints her as a free-spirited woman living without the restrictions of characters like Snow White. However, the aspect of her more sexual image that is holding this character back from being fully progressive is arguably the fact that her sexual expression is still very much in relation to the entertainment of the male gaze. This is due to her story being based around her male relationships and the attention she receives from men. There’s a thin line between designing a sexually confident and expressive female character and designing a female character placing emphasis on “sex appeal.” I believe Pocahontas certainly walks this line which potentially hinders her progression and independence by still placing some of her sexual expression on the dependence on men.\n\nWe observe the character Queen Elsa as she brings our ideas here full circle. I believe Elsa offers a middle ground between these two ideas. These are presented in the initial portrayal of her conservative and restricted nature similar to Snow White to her eventual liberation and freedom of Pocahontas. Elsa's character design includes two different dresses. Her first, more conservative style includes an tightly done up hairstyle akin to Snow White. She sports a floor length dress, cape and symbolic gloves. Gloves in literature and films often symbolize the concealing of true motives, desires, sexuality or power. The gloves are ripped off both figuratively and literally during her transition to her next style. Her second dress is not just a pretty dress but offers a glimpse at symbolism for female sexuality. This style includes an icy blue dress with a slit in the leg, which hints at an openness towards female sexuality, and a long icy cape. During this transition we also see her undoing her hair in a dramatic fashion, figuratively and literally “letting her hair down,” similarly changing from Snow White's up-do to Pocahontas's freely flowing locks. In addition, we see many instances of body language playing into this symbolic embracing of female sexuality. During this change we see Elsa swinging her hips and freely throwing her arms up while “letting it go.” What I believe is most important here is that  this act of sexual liberation doesn’t have to be in position to entertain a man. Arguably, we couldn’t say this for Pocahontas whose story still very much places emphasis on men. Too often female sexuality, when it’s not condemned, is looked at as something that's sole purpose is for the pleasing of men, as we see here that there was no John Smith or Prince Charming character for which she felt the need to impress. She never even has any sort of male love interest in the film at all, this symbolic sexual liberation takes place when she is completely by herself. This further shows Elsa’s sexual liberation coming from her accepting who she is and the powers she has. Female sexual liberation or expression can and should be born out of one's own self-confidence and independence rather than being centered around male attention. It’s also important to observe the stages from shame to celebration through the portrayal of her initial conservative and fearful mindset to her eventual liberation and fearlessness. At the beginning we see many instances of the dangers of holding oneself back. She sings, “Be the good girl you always have to be, conceal, don't feel, put on a show.” Many girls in society before and even today are commonly raised to sit down and be quiet and to not be open with one's sexuality the ways boys are. We see through Elsa just how a woman can be negatively affected by being taught these things and “putting on a show.” I believe that her powers over ice and snow represent something more than just a magical aspect of the film. The way this magic is treated seems to symbolize female sexuality; it’s something beautiful and completely natural, but is shunned and shamed. Her parents forcing her to wear gloves to conceal her supernatural powers further shows this type of restriction she has been taught. So much so that when her true self is finally revealed, she reacts with fear and shame, showcasing the dangers of these strict standards and restrictions. However, her liberation and independence is celebrated, becoming a pivotal point in the film. The song “Let it Go” can be analyzed as having an underlying sexual liberation theme. The embracing of female freedom and sexuality and the rejection of strict regulations offer a much better and healthier message to audiences rather than the promotion of female conservativeness, innocence and non-sexuality. The repression of one’s sexuality due to societal expectations is shown in this film as a dangerous mindset. Her icy powers only caused her trouble when she had this mindset.\n\nConcerning sexuality and gender roles, the role that romance plays and the role of the men opposite these women offers an obvious relation. In the film *Snow White and the Seven Dwarves*, Snow White meets her love interest, a nameless prince, and immediately falls in love. We have seen how Snow White is an idealized image of what a woman was supposed to be, and here she assumes one of the “acceptable” roles a woman could hold, that of the wife. The archetype of the Damsel in Distress is present within the character of Snow White. We see the Prince as the Hero, saving Snow White, who’s rendered helpless until he kisses her. I believe that this entire scene shows her role of sexuality being condemned. As discussed before, the sexual symbol of the apple puts her in a sleeping death, which is only redeemed when the male comes and plays the active role. Despite the themes that this story seems to promote, placing full dependence on love or a man to save your life is simply not a healthy way to live.\n\nThe film *Pocahontas* introduces us to the fictitious romance between Powhatan Princess Pocahontas and English Explorer John Smith. Their love story offers a much more complex pairing versus Snow White and her nameless rent-a-prince. The gender roles of this love story, especially compared to Snow White seem to be counter-stereotypical. An interesting study done by Dawn England examined each movie and describes each instance of these Disney characters exhibiting stereotypical “masculine” and “feminine” gender roles. This study observed the masculine traits in characters, examples involve such stereotypical male traits in fairy tales ranging from brave to violent. Conversely the feminine traits taken into consideration in this study include things like docile or gentleness. According to England’s study, Pocahontas exhibits 105 “masculine” versus 130 “feminine,” this is much closer to equal than Snow White exhibiting only 13 instances of the masculine gender role, and 137 feminine (558). This is a stark contrast that statistically shows the difference between Snow White and Pocahontas' relation to gender roles, which heavily reflects upon their roles in their romances. A prime example of this reversal of gender roles is seen upon John Smith's near execution. As we see, it is Pocahontas who is throwing her body over John, willing to sacrifice her own life for his. This places Pocahontas in a position of power and dominance and John Smith in a role of helplessness, effectively eliminating that aspect of the damsel in distress motif. The woman is no longer needs to be saved but she is now the savior. Also unlike her poison apple eating predecessor, I have found that Pocahontas takes the notion that she “needs to be saved” as an insult. This is seen in an earlier scene when John Smith tells Pocahontas how he and his fellow Englishmen have “improved the lives of savages everywhere” to which she takes obvious insult. This negative reaction to needing to be saved is important to note in discussions of the “female needing rescue” motif. Another major difference in the love story of this film is in its ending. Upon John Smith needing to return to England he extends Pocahontas an invitation to join him but she declines.  While the film is ultimately based upon romance, Pocahontas is no damsel in distress, and places her priority on her family and her people rather than chasing romantic love, further painting her as a strong woman independent from men. Unlike Snow White, she does not assume the “acceptable” role as a man's wife. I believe all of these things go to show that romantic relations do not always have to act as a hindrance to female strength and that there is power of family over romance, both of which are further expanded upon in later films.\n\nTaking this evolution a step above Pocahontas, for the first time our heroine, Elsa, never has a love interest at all. In fact there is little to no mention of Elsa's romantic life in the film. Her story simply does not need to involve a man; her emotions, motives and aspirations are more than complex enough to tell a story. While a female's romantic relationships don’t have to be a threat to her characterization, it’s important to show a heroine whose story doesn’t have to involve such themes in the first place. This is an obvious intentional message to send, and is where Elsa comes in a step above Pocahontas. However, Elsa's relationship to other men concerning her role as a woman is still important to her story. I observe Elsa as a symbol of a threat to male power. Upon the revelation of her magic, she’s immediately demonized mostly by the men around her. It’s also important to note that this revelation takes place during Elsa's coronation as queen. She’s already literally displaying her political power as queen, to which certain characters look to exploit. Specifically the character of The Duke of Weaselton, thinking out loud upon entering the palace he says “Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches!” This is why Elsa's powers are so frightening to him: he proclaims Elsa as a “monster” because she has a power, which he doesn’t understand and therefore cannot effectively control. She has the ability to do something that’s out of the control of men and that scares them. Their only chance is to try to tear her down by demonizing her magic. Historically, this theme is exemplified with many “Witch Hunts” throughout history, where, due to a fear of women gaining power, many girls would be falsely accused of evil magic. It’s not a coincidence that “evil” witches are stereotypically female. Elsa's overcoming of this patriarchal demonization of her supernatural and political power proves to be a dire aspect in the film. As we see, unlike Snow White, men can be, and often are, the very source of the main conflict rather than the solution.\n\nWhen observing a female character's independence from men it’s important to observe the nature of the relationships she forms with fellow women. Many female relationships too often fall to the sidelines, or into one category; competition. When fellow women are seen only as competition for male affection it severely hinders her independence. Just like Snow White's only female-to-female relationship with the Evil Queen. “Since physical appearance has traditionally been the most valuable asset for a woman, beauty makes her eligible for marriage, it should come as no surprise that anyone considered superior in beauty is an enemy that must be destroyed.” (González). We see this as an example in the Evil Queen's vice being born out of her envy of Snow White being “Fairest of them all”. As González indicates, this motive is a result of the importance society has--and still--places on female beauty and attractiveness. Expanding upon this idea, the Queen’s vanity and evilness play into one of only two categories most female characters fell into. Usually a female character was either the good “virgin” or the evil “whore.” González describes the Queen in relation to this “virgin-whore motif as, “The old, fallen woman, as the representation of the world of experience from which the heroine must be preserved, is introduced as a threat to the eternal state of innocence in which a woman is expected to remain” (204). It would seem that a woman who doesn’t remain in a state of innocence or male dependence is a menace. To expand on this idea, I observe the intention of these characterizations is for the audience to be conditioned to see Snow White’s innocence and dependence on a man as a positive aspects and, as discussed before, ideals for how women were supposed to act, while the Queen’s independence, power, and lack of a King is portrayed along with negativity, jealousy and evilness, how a woman was expected to oppose. This paints female independence as something that can only be seen in one who is threatening and harmful. This “Virgin versus Whore” motif proves to be overall problematic as it overly simplifies the portrayal of what a woman could be in film and society and demonizes females with power independent from men.\n\nWhile Snow White's only female-to-female exchange came in the form of a deadly competition with a jealous queen, we see Pocahontas forming positive and rewarding relationships with other females. Pocahontas's very first interaction within her film is with her female best friend, Nakoma. The nature of their relationship is not one of rivalry or competition for a man's affection, but rather of protection and mutual support. Upon learning of Pocahontas's relationship with a white settler, Nakoma's reaction does not include any jealousy or rivalry but rather she caringly and concerningly grabs her hand and says, “Pocahontas, please. You're my best friend. I don't want you to get hurt.” The caring nature of her best friend lends to the idea that females can and should protect and build each other up, rather than tear each other down in the name of a man.  I believe this relationship was written to further show that female characters only motives don’t have to involve male affection. However, we often see Pocahontas not listening to Nakoma's caring voice of reason, and we still see this relationship as secondary to the romance and too often falls to the sidelines in favor of her relationship with a man. The historical figure of Pocahontas offers many interesting stories and lessons yet the film and design of her character definitely gravitate towards her male relationships. While this female relationship is positively portrayed and rewarding, we don’t see female-to-female bonds as a focus of a film until 2013's Frozen.\n\nThe relationship Elsa has with her sister Anna is important because it is the main course of the film rather than a side dish. It shows the strength of the sisterly bond has in place of romantic bonds. One aspect of their relationship that comes into play when discussing the ideals of feminism within the film is their differing views of romance. Elsa responds to Anna’s engagement by saying, “What do you understand about true love? You can't marry a man you just met,” effectively crushing the dreams of the majority of her fellow Disney princesses. This viewpoint proves to be quite useful as the character whom Anna wished to marry, Hans, is revealed to be the true antagonist of the film. I believe this twist serves to show the fault of the “love at first sight” motif that is all too common in fairy tales. It’s not always a good idea to wed the first guy who sings a duet with you. Sure, in real life maybe he won't try to kill you and your sister and take your kingdom, but Elsa’s maturity and caring for her sister in this situation further paints her as a powerful and independent female role model. In fact, the “act of true love” comes from their sisterly bond, rather than a man. This aspect of their relationship is crucial. We see Anna sacrificing herself to save Elsa's life from the man she was almost ready to marry. However, not only does her act of sacrifice manage to save Elsa's life, it has in turn saved Anna's as her frozen heart begins to thaw. They have effectively saved each other's lives without the help of Prince Charming. The hero-damsel motif isn’t just reversed, it is dismantled in this example. We have seen *Snow White's* conflict a result of a female and her solution coming from a man saving the girl. In *Pocahontas* we then see the girl being the one to save the man. However with *Frozen* we see the problem stemming from men and a female-to-female bond being the ultimate solution. The film's entire main focus being on the power of strong female relationships and independence from men is an excellent example of the evolution from the days of poison apples.\n\n To expand on this traditionally negative connotation of female independence, I believe we see Elsa have more in common with the female villains of the past, such as the Evil Queen, rather than the supposed heroines: “Female independence has traditionally been perceived as a menace for the order established by patriarchal society, A woman who decides not to adapt herself to the traditional roles is seen as going against what nature has intended for her” (González 203).  If we are to draw a comparison between The Snow Queen of 2013 and The Evil Queen of 1937, it is easy to identify the evolution. They both hold absolute monarch political power without a king; They both practice some sort of supernatural magic; They are both powerful, independent and misunderstood and shunned by their community. However, the portrayal of Elsa as a protagonist rather than an antagonist is crucial. The Evil Queen is written as a purely evil villain, demonized by both the audience and producers, as González has mentioned. While Elsa is portrayed as heroic and misunderstood, feeling the negative effects of such attitudes held by the men in her world against female power and independence. An important comparison to draw upon is the use of the word “fool.” This word has become a favorite amongst villains such as Maleficent and the Evil Queen, often used to demean their henchmen or the protagonist. However Elsa uses it in a different way. “I'm such a fool, I can't be free” she sings. The only difference here is Elsa is directing the word at herself rather than others, tying her to the villain the men in the world lead her to believe she is. It shows a sort of internalized self-criticism taught to girls who dare to exhibit the independence, power, or differences traditionally portrayed by villains. Another aspect that is pivotal to their understanding is the intended reaction for these characters from their respective audiences. The audience of 1937’s *Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs* is lead to see the powerful and independent female as a threat, with negative intentions, wicked jealousy and disregard. However, the audience of 2013’s *Frozen* is lead to see this powerful and independent female as a misunderstood hero, one who takes control of her own destiny and sets a good example. Female independence doesn’t have to come from jealous and evil villains, but can and should be born out of heroines. One may argue that with the female villains, Disney has been portraying strong and independent females all along. However, I would argue that there is an underlying negative message in portraying these things in antagonists. It would seem as though it is saying that females exhibiting these strengths and powers are doomed to be defeated, and receive an unhappy ending. While powerless and weaker female characters are the ones that receive, or “deserve” a happy ending. When self-sufficiency, sexuality and strength in female characters is only shown in the evil villains it provides an overall negative connotation to an audience of impressionable young kids. This makes protagonists displaying these traits all the more important.\n\nMusic plays an important role, not only in the plot development, but also in offering a look into the messages of the films as well. Snow White sings the song “Someday My Prince Will Come.” The title itself lends to the passive dependence women were expected to take within romance and life that we have previously discussed. In the present day it is easy to see how this message doesn’t exactly work. Taken directly from the piece, “Wedding bells will ring, Someday when my dreams come true”. This presents the idea that a woman’s “dreams coming true” usually only involving “wedding bells ringing”. The way this idea is presented in the song is as if the only acceptable dream for women is being a wife dependent on males, which goes back to Snow White’s overall portrayal being based upon the strict standards and ideals society had for females.\n\nIn Pocahontas’ “Just Around the Riverbend,” “Pocahontas’ dissatisfaction subverts the conventions of previous Disney songs” (Zarranz 58). This song presents her dissatisfaction with another character, Kocoum's, marriage proposal. Pocahontas sings that she “ignores the sound of distant drumming” for a “handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls.” Along with this contrast, another interesting example of this subversion is in lyrics, from Snow White's “Dreams Coming True” when “Wedding Bells Ring,” to Pocahontas singing “Should I Marry Kocoum? Is All My Dreaming at an End?” This direct contrast not only paints a woman's dreams as something more than just finding a handsome, sturdy husband, but also showing that it could in fact signal the end of her dreams. So while Snow White exhibits the idealized and ultimately outdated and harmful concept that a woman's wedding is the pinnacle of her life, Pocahontas exhibits the opposite. This song rather paints marriage as something she is dreading, rather than dreaming of. The song also paints Pocahontas as a very active part of her love life. While Snow White may sit at the riverbank waiting for high tide to bring in whatever prince she sings a duet with first, Pocahontas jumps right in, listens to her heart and wants to make her own decisions in her romantic life.\n\nJust like discussed previously, Elsa's story and song “Let it Go” do not involve romantic love in the first place. While Snow White sings about a dream marriage proposal, and Pocahontas sings of a rejection of such concepts, Elsa's main number is about her own liberation and power. This takes the ideas of female independence and freedom a step above Pocahontas and a leap above Snow White. Many lines of the song lend to the ideas of female independence, power and even underlying tones of sexual liberation. From the first verse's “I couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried” to the second verse's “The fears that once controlled me, can't get to me at all” addresses the restrictions Elsa, and many females, have experienced through both historic and modern society's impossible standards for women. Elsa associates her power with fear and misunderstanding, but within this number we see not only acceptance, but celebration of being powerful. This also examines the danger of women living with such restrictions over their lives. Those restrictions only serve to create a sense of shame, fear and inequality from their male counterparts. “Let it Go” definitely ties us back to the ideas of sexual liberation through various undertones in the lyrics. The lyric that I believe sums up the entire idea of the song comes in the final chorus, “Let it go and I'll rise like the break of dawn, let it go That perfect girl is gone, here I stand in the light of day.” “That Perfect Girl is Gone” not only excellently sums up the message of this song and film, but of the entire idea that I’m researching. The strive for perfection and unrealistic standards of beauty, femininity and the roles women are “supposed” to play in society are harmful and effectively “let go.” While, Elsa shows us the harms when we try to abide by these outdated expectations of Snow White, she also exhibits the liberation experienced when they are let go and is free and liberated similar to Pocahontas and takes it a step further.\n\nWhile the strives the Disney studios have made in terms of their portrayals of female independence within their films has proven to be quite progressive, it’s important to note that even the most recent characters and films aren’t without issues in terms of gender relations and equality. While, as discussed, it’s healthy for female sexuality to be more freely expressed, there is a line to be drawn between portraying females that are confident with their sexuality and females designed simply for sex appeal. This isn’t to say that certain misguided decisions behind the scenes totally discredit the positive aspects of these characters. An interesting project that I have come across called the “RealPrincess” which I found to be an excellent example of putting pressure on Disney studios to expand even further with their feminist evolution. This project entailed girls drawing their version of “Real Princesses” which included princess who were either non-attractive, plus-sized, disabled, gay, transgender, and other aspects not yet explored by Disney. We’ve seen unattractive males as protagonists but all of the females have been relatively pretty. I would like to think conversations like this would encourage a mainstream and popular studio like Disney to display these people's different stories to their broad audience and would just hope that the audience would be receptive these different Princesses. However, if there is any criticism of this article, I would say that the strawman fallacy is utilized here by setting up these characters as easier to knock down. “One of the most nefarious aspects of the traditional Disney princess model is the stereotypical, hyper-feminine ideals their narratives promote” (Zellinger 3). The author seems to broadly generalize all of Disney's female protagonists by the older stereotype of helpless damsels in distress in order to further make their argument. I feel Pocahontas, Mulan and Elsa are important points of progression, although their role as relatively attractive females remain. It is important to keep a certain amount of pressure on our media to keep striving to improve the portrayals of females, however, it is also important to still offer praise and encouragement for improvements that we do see.\n\nThese three characters offer a glimpse into the overall evolution of female characters within Disney films. Putting them side by side we see how the portrayals of female liberation has gradually improved, results varying from a passive, naïve and virginal young girl to confident, strong willed and three-dimensional young women. It seems the further we venture into demonstrating complexity, independence and imperfections in females the closer we get to achieving the perfect female role model.\n\n### Works Cited\nEngland, D.

The princesses have littered young children's bedrooms, theme parks and films for nearly a century and in turn have become a large topic of debate and observation. These conversations vary from praise to criticism; the focus has been on the ever-changing portrayal of female independence, strength and sexuality throughout the years. Snow White from the film *Snow White and the Seven Dwarves* represents a positive portrayal of female repression and restriction, while Pocahontas from the film *Pocahontas* represents a positive portrayal of female freedom. Elsa from the film *Frozen* acts as a bridge between these two, looking to exhibit the dangers of female restrictions such as Snow White and the celebration of female liberation and freedom such as Pocahontas, which paints her as a three-dimensional heroine exhibiting this progression. However I look to argue that, despite popular opinions and social media reactions to *Frozen*, Elsa is definitely not the first female heroine to exhibit independence, a healthy sexual expression or strength. I would like to show how there has been a gradual linear progression of these aspects all along that has increasingly improved over time, rather than overnight. I look to make this argument by examining the expression of female sexuality and independence and how it has progressed over time in different ways through three Disney heroines.\n\nOur three heroines can be seen as examples of how females presented different stages of independence and sexual expression in film. Nearly eighty years ago we were introduced to the beautiful and innocent, yet passive Snow White. Displaying the beauty ideals of a young female and the part which she plays in society in her film, Snow White can be looked at as an example of how females were expected to be behave. Flash forward nearly fifty-seven years and we’re introduced to an entirely different type of heroine; the Native American Pocahontas proves to show a different side of what a female character can possibly be. An independent, free-spirited daydreamer, Pocahontas plays a much more active role in her life and is portrayed as a liberated and powerful character. In an icy blast we find ourselves in present day where just less than two years ago we were introduced to the Snow Queen of Arendelle. We see this character go from the villain of the original tale to a complex anti-hero of the final film. Not only does Elsa offer us a celebration of an independent and powerful female character, but she also the shows downfall of restricting such strengths.\n\nWhen we are discussing the roles a female character plays in relation to the stereotypical gender roles and the portrayal of her independence the female’s expression of sexuality is a pivotal plot point. In family films like these we usually see sexuality as an underlying theme, being expressed through various symbols and subtle characterizations. The expression of female sexuality has gone through many different steps to get to where we are today. Snow White is presented as the idealized patriarchal figure of what women should emulate: Snow White is non-sexual, conservative, naïve, innocent and passive. Her character design includes a long dress, a modest neckline, and hair done-up tightly while her body language can be described as modest, restricted and proper. All of these physical traits can easily play into the ideal of how women “should” think and behave. An important symbol in the film for sexuality is the apple. With the allusion to the temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden, Snow White's apple symbolizes a sexual and deadly temptation, sending an underlying message of the “danger” of a female expressing her “sinful” sexuality. We see this apple offered by the only other female character. This further paints the image that all sin arises from the temptation of females (those who don’t emulate Snow White's brand of innocence). Snow White effectively “dies” from even one taste of this “sin” only to be rescued by a man. I believe that this not only places Snow White in a helpless role, but also sends a message that sexuality is only appropriate or redeemable when it’s a male perpetrating the action.\n\nIf we’re to compare Snow White to Pocahontas, it’s almost the complete opposite. Looking at character design we see Pocahontas as having a more curvy or sexualized image, with a short dress, an off-the-shoulder neckline, all completed with her hair down. Hair can act as a symbol for sexuality or expressive freedom. Specifically in that Snow White's uptight, structured and modest hair style offers a glimpse into her conservative role concerning sexuality while Pocahontas's raven hair frequently seen flowing in the wind can be looked at as more sexually liberated. Pocahontas also sports a tattoo, which would be hard to imagine on Snow White. Tattoos in literature are often symbols of individuality or freedom of expression. This sense of freedom is very important in her characterization. “Pocahontas has her mother's spirit, she goes wherever the wind takes her” are the first words spoken of her. Her character is also frequently seen running and jumping throughout the film, a clear contrast from Snow White's reserved body language. This introduction to her character paints her as a free-spirited woman living without the restrictions of characters like Snow White. However, the aspect of her more sexual image that is holding this character back from being fully progressive is arguably the fact that her sexual expression is still very much in relation to the entertainment of the male gaze. This is due to her story being based around her male relationships and the attention she receives from men. There’s a thin line between designing a sexually confident and expressive female character and designing a female character placing emphasis on “sex appeal.” I believe Pocahontas certainly walks this line which potentially hinders her progression and independence by still placing some of her sexual expression on the dependence on men.\n\nWe observe the character Queen Elsa as she brings our ideas here full circle. I believe Elsa offers a middle ground between these two ideas. These are presented in the initial portrayal of her conservative and restricted nature similar to Snow White to her eventual liberation and freedom of Pocahontas. Elsa's character design includes two different dresses. Her first, more conservative style includes an tightly done up hairstyle akin to Snow White. She sports a floor length dress, cape and symbolic gloves. Gloves in literature and films often symbolize the concealing of true motives, desires, sexuality or power. The gloves are ripped off both figuratively and literally during her transition to her next style. Her second dress is not just a pretty dress but offers a glimpse at symbolism for female sexuality. This style includes an icy blue dress with a slit in the leg, which hints at an openness towards female sexuality, and a long icy cape. During this transition we also see her undoing her hair in a dramatic fashion, figuratively and literally “letting her hair down,” similarly changing from Snow White's up-do to Pocahontas's freely flowing locks. In addition, we see many instances of body language playing into this symbolic embracing of female sexuality. During this change we see Elsa swinging her hips and freely throwing her arms up while “letting it go.” What I believe is most important here is that  this act of sexual liberation doesn’t have to be in position to entertain a man. Arguably, we couldn’t say this for Pocahontas whose story still very much places emphasis on men. Too often female sexuality, when it’s not condemned, is looked at as something that's sole purpose is for the pleasing of men, as we see here that there was no John Smith or Prince Charming character for which she felt the need to impress. She never even has any sort of male love interest in the film at all, this symbolic sexual liberation takes place when she is completely by herself. This further shows Elsa’s sexual liberation coming from her accepting who she is and the powers she has. Female sexual liberation or expression can and should be born out of one's own self-confidence and independence rather than being centered around male attention. It’s also important to observe the stages from shame to celebration through the portrayal of her initial conservative and fearful mindset to her eventual liberation and fearlessness. At the beginning we see many instances of the dangers of holding oneself back. She sings, “Be the good girl you always have to be, conceal, don't feel, put on a show.” Many girls in society before and even today are commonly raised to sit down and be quiet and to not be open with one's sexuality the ways boys are. We see through Elsa just how a woman can be negatively affected by being taught these things and “putting on a show.” I believe that her powers over ice and snow represent something more than just a magical aspect of the film. The way this magic is treated seems to symbolize female sexuality; it’s something beautiful and completely natural, but is shunned and shamed. Her parents forcing her to wear gloves to conceal her supernatural powers further shows this type of restriction she has been taught. So much so that when her true self is finally revealed, she reacts with fear and shame, showcasing the dangers of these strict standards and restrictions. However, her liberation and independence is celebrated, becoming a pivotal point in the film. The song “Let it Go” can be analyzed as having an underlying sexual liberation theme. The embracing of female freedom and sexuality and the rejection of strict regulations offer a much better and healthier message to audiences rather than the promotion of female conservativeness, innocence and non-sexuality. The repression of one’s sexuality due to societal expectations is shown in this film as a dangerous mindset. Her icy powers only caused her trouble when she had this mindset.\n\nConcerning sexuality and gender roles, the role that romance plays and the role of the men opposite these women offers an obvious relation. In the film *Snow White and the Seven Dwarves*, Snow White meets her love interest, a nameless prince, and immediately falls in love. We have seen how Snow White is an idealized image of what a woman was supposed to be, and here she assumes one of the “acceptable” roles a woman could hold, that of the wife. The archetype of the Damsel in Distress is present within the character of Snow White. We see the Prince as the Hero, saving Snow White, who’s rendered helpless until he kisses her. I believe that this entire scene shows her role of sexuality being condemned. As discussed before, the sexual symbol of the apple puts her in a sleeping death, which is only redeemed when the male comes and plays the active role. Despite the themes that this story seems to promote, placing full dependence on love or a man to save your life is simply not a healthy way to live.\n\nThe film *Pocahontas* introduces us to the fictitious romance between Powhatan Princess Pocahontas and English Explorer John Smith. Their love story offers a much more complex pairing versus Snow White and her nameless rent-a-prince. The gender roles of this love story, especially compared to Snow White seem to be counter-stereotypical. An interesting study done by Dawn England examined each movie and describes each instance of these Disney characters exhibiting stereotypical “masculine” and “feminine” gender roles. This study observed the masculine traits in characters, examples involve such stereotypical male traits in fairy tales ranging from brave to violent. Conversely the feminine traits taken into consideration in this study include things like docile or gentleness. According to England’s study, Pocahontas exhibits 105 “masculine” versus 130 “feminine,” this is much closer to equal than Snow White exhibiting only 13 instances of the masculine gender role, and 137 feminine (558). This is a stark contrast that statistically shows the difference between Snow White and Pocahontas' relation to gender roles, which heavily reflects upon their roles in their romances. A prime example of this reversal of gender roles is seen upon John Smith's near execution. As we see, it is Pocahontas who is throwing her body over John, willing to sacrifice her own life for his. This places Pocahontas in a position of power and dominance and John Smith in a role of helplessness, effectively eliminating that aspect of the damsel in distress motif. The woman is no longer needs to be saved but she is now the savior. Also unlike her poison apple eating predecessor, I have found that Pocahontas takes the notion that she “needs to be saved” as an insult. This is seen in an earlier scene when John Smith tells Pocahontas how he and his fellow Englishmen have “improved the lives of savages everywhere” to which she takes obvious insult. This negative reaction to needing to be saved is important to note in discussions of the “female needing rescue” motif. Another major difference in the love story of this film is in its ending. Upon John Smith needing to return to England he extends Pocahontas an invitation to join him but she declines.  While the film is ultimately based upon romance, Pocahontas is no damsel in distress, and places her priority on her family and her people rather than chasing romantic love, further painting her as a strong woman independent from men. Unlike Snow White, she does not assume the “acceptable” role as a man's wife. I believe all of these things go to show that romantic relations do not always have to act as a hindrance to female strength and that there is power of family over romance, both of which are further expanded upon in later films.\n\nTaking this evolution a step above Pocahontas, for the first time our heroine, Elsa, never has a love interest at all. In fact there is little to no mention of Elsa's romantic life in the film. Her story simply does not need to involve a man; her emotions, motives and aspirations are more than complex enough to tell a story. While a female's romantic relationships don’t have to be a threat to her characterization, it’s important to show a heroine whose story doesn’t have to involve such themes in the first place. This is an obvious intentional message to send, and is where Elsa comes in a step above Pocahontas. However, Elsa's relationship to other men concerning her role as a woman is still important to her story. I observe Elsa as a symbol of a threat to male power. Upon the revelation of her magic, she’s immediately demonized mostly by the men around her. It’s also important to note that this revelation takes place during Elsa's coronation as queen. She’s already literally displaying her political power as queen, to which certain characters look to exploit. Specifically the character of The Duke of Weaselton, thinking out loud upon entering the palace he says “Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches!” This is why Elsa's powers are so frightening to him: he proclaims Elsa as a “monster” because she has a power, which he doesn’t understand and therefore cannot effectively control. She has the ability to do something that’s out of the control of men and that scares them. Their only chance is to try to tear her down by demonizing her magic. Historically, this theme is exemplified with many “Witch Hunts” throughout history, where, due to a fear of women gaining power, many girls would be falsely accused of evil magic. It’s not a coincidence that “evil” witches are stereotypically female. Elsa's overcoming of this patriarchal demonization of her supernatural and political power proves to be a dire aspect in the film. As we see, unlike Snow White, men can be, and often are, the very source of the main conflict rather than the solution.\n\nWhen observing a female character's independence from men it’s important to observe the nature of the relationships she forms with fellow women. Many female relationships too often fall to the sidelines, or into one category; competition. When fellow women are seen only as competition for male affection it severely hinders her independence. Just like Snow White's only female-to-female relationship with the Evil Queen. “Since physical appearance has traditionally been the most valuable asset for a woman, beauty makes her eligible for marriage, it should come as no surprise that anyone considered superior in beauty is an enemy that must be destroyed.” (González). We see this as an example in the Evil Queen's vice being born out of her envy of Snow White being “Fairest of them all”. As González indicates, this motive is a result of the importance society has--and still--places on female beauty and attractiveness. Expanding upon this idea, the Queen’s vanity and evilness play into one of only two categories most female characters fell into. Usually a female character was either the good “virgin” or the evil “whore.” González describes the Queen in relation to this “virgin-whore motif as, “The old, fallen woman, as the representation of the world of experience from which the heroine must be preserved, is introduced as a threat to the eternal state of innocence in which a woman is expected to remain” (204). It would seem that a woman who doesn’t remain in a state of innocence or male dependence is a menace. To expand on this idea, I observe the intention of these characterizations is for the audience to be conditioned to see Snow White’s innocence and dependence on a man as a positive aspects and, as discussed before, ideals for how women were supposed to act, while the Queen’s independence, power, and lack of a King is portrayed along with negativity, jealousy and evilness, how a woman was expected to oppose. This paints female independence as something that can only be seen in one who is threatening and harmful. This “Virgin versus Whore” motif proves to be overall problematic as it overly simplifies the portrayal of what a woman could be in film and society and demonizes females with power independent from men.\n\nWhile Snow White's only female-to-female exchange came in the form of a deadly competition with a jealous queen, we see Pocahontas forming positive and rewarding relationships with other females. Pocahontas's very first interaction within her film is with her female best friend, Nakoma. The nature of their relationship is not one of rivalry or competition for a man's affection, but rather of protection and mutual support. Upon learning of Pocahontas's relationship with a white settler, Nakoma's reaction does not include any jealousy or rivalry but rather she caringly and concerningly grabs her hand and says, “Pocahontas, please. You're my best friend. I don't want you to get hurt.” The caring nature of her best friend lends to the idea that females can and should protect and build each other up, rather than tear each other down in the name of a man.  I believe this relationship was written to further show that female characters only motives don’t have to involve male affection. However, we often see Pocahontas not listening to Nakoma's caring voice of reason, and we still see this relationship as secondary to the romance and too often falls to the sidelines in favor of her relationship with a man. The historical figure of Pocahontas offers many interesting stories and lessons yet the film and design of her character definitely gravitate towards her male relationships. While this female relationship is positively portrayed and rewarding, we don’t see female-to-female bonds as a focus of a film until 2013's Frozen.\n\nThe relationship Elsa has with her sister Anna is important because it is the main course of the film rather than a side dish. It shows the strength of the sisterly bond has in place of romantic bonds. One aspect of their relationship that comes into play when discussing the ideals of feminism within the film is their differing views of romance. Elsa responds to Anna’s engagement by saying, “What do you understand about true love? You can't marry a man you just met,” effectively crushing the dreams of the majority of her fellow Disney princesses. This viewpoint proves to be quite useful as the character whom Anna wished to marry, Hans, is revealed to be the true antagonist of the film. I believe this twist serves to show the fault of the “love at first sight” motif that is all too common in fairy tales. It’s not always a good idea to wed the first guy who sings a duet with you. Sure, in real life maybe he won't try to kill you and your sister and take your kingdom, but Elsa’s maturity and caring for her sister in this situation further paints her as a powerful and independent female role model. In fact, the “act of true love” comes from their sisterly bond, rather than a man. This aspect of their relationship is crucial. We see Anna sacrificing herself to save Elsa's life from the man she was almost ready to marry. However, not only does her act of sacrifice manage to save Elsa's life, it has in turn saved Anna's as her frozen heart begins to thaw. They have effectively saved each other's lives without the help of Prince Charming. The hero-damsel motif isn’t just reversed, it is dismantled in this example. We have seen *Snow White's* conflict a result of a female and her solution coming from a man saving the girl. In *Pocahontas* we then see the girl being the one to save the man. However with *Frozen* we see the problem stemming from men and a female-to-female bond being the ultimate solution. The film's entire main focus being on the power of strong female relationships and independence from men is an excellent example of the evolution from the days of poison apples.\n\n To expand on this traditionally negative connotation of female independence, I believe we see Elsa have more in common with the female villains of the past, such as the Evil Queen, rather than the supposed heroines: “Female independence has traditionally been perceived as a menace for the order established by patriarchal society, A woman who decides not to adapt herself to the traditional roles is seen as going against what nature has intended for her” (González 203).  If we are to draw a comparison between The Snow Queen of 2013 and The Evil Queen of 1937, it is easy to identify the evolution. They both hold absolute monarch political power without a king; They both practice some sort of supernatural magic; They are both powerful, independent and misunderstood and shunned by their community. However, the portrayal of Elsa as a protagonist rather than an antagonist is crucial. The Evil Queen is written as a purely evil villain, demonized by both the audience and producers, as González has mentioned. While Elsa is portrayed as heroic and misunderstood, feeling the negative effects of such attitudes held by the men in her world against female power and independence. An important comparison to draw upon is the use of the word “fool.” This word has become a favorite amongst villains such as Maleficent and the Evil Queen, often used to demean their henchmen or the protagonist. However Elsa uses it in a different way. “I'm such a fool, I can't be free” she sings. The only difference here is Elsa is directing the word at herself rather than others, tying her to the villain the men in the world lead her to believe she is. It shows a sort of internalized self-criticism taught to girls who dare to exhibit the independence, power, or differences traditionally portrayed by villains. Another aspect that is pivotal to their understanding is the intended reaction for these characters from their respective audiences. The audience of 1937’s *Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs* is lead to see the powerful and independent female as a threat, with negative intentions, wicked jealousy and disregard. However, the audience of 2013’s *Frozen* is lead to see this powerful and independent female as a misunderstood hero, one who takes control of her own destiny and sets a good example. Female independence doesn’t have to come from jealous and evil villains, but can and should be born out of heroines. One may argue that with the female villains, Disney has been portraying strong and independent females all along. However, I would argue that there is an underlying negative message in portraying these things in antagonists. It would seem as though it is saying that females exhibiting these strengths and powers are doomed to be defeated, and receive an unhappy ending. While powerless and weaker female characters are the ones that receive, or “deserve” a happy ending. When self-sufficiency, sexuality and strength in female characters is only shown in the evil villains it provides an overall negative connotation to an audience of impressionable young kids. This makes protagonists displaying these traits all the more important.\n\nMusic plays an important role, not only in the plot development, but also in offering a look into the messages of the films as well. Snow White sings the song “Someday My Prince Will Come.” The title itself lends to the passive dependence women were expected to take within romance and life that we have previously discussed. In the present day it is easy to see how this message doesn’t exactly work. Taken directly from the piece, “Wedding bells will ring, Someday when my dreams come true”. This presents the idea that a woman’s “dreams coming true” usually only involving “wedding bells ringing”. The way this idea is presented in the song is as if the only acceptable dream for women is being a wife dependent on males, which goes back to Snow White’s overall portrayal being based upon the strict standards and ideals society had for females.\n\nIn Pocahontas’ “Just Around the Riverbend,” “Pocahontas’ dissatisfaction subverts the conventions of previous Disney songs” (Zarranz 58). This song presents her dissatisfaction with another character, Kocoum's, marriage proposal. Pocahontas sings that she “ignores the sound of distant drumming” for a “handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls.” Along with this contrast, another interesting example of this subversion is in lyrics, from Snow White's “Dreams Coming True” when “Wedding Bells Ring,” to Pocahontas singing “Should I Marry Kocoum? Is All My Dreaming at an End?” This direct contrast not only paints a woman's dreams as something more than just finding a handsome, sturdy husband, but also showing that it could in fact signal the end of her dreams. So while Snow White exhibits the idealized and ultimately outdated and harmful concept that a woman's wedding is the pinnacle of her life, Pocahontas exhibits the opposite. This song rather paints marriage as something she is dreading, rather than dreaming of. The song also paints Pocahontas as a very active part of her love life. While Snow White may sit at the riverbank waiting for high tide to bring in whatever prince she sings a duet with first, Pocahontas jumps right in, listens to her heart and wants to make her own decisions in her romantic life.\n\nJust like discussed previously, Elsa's story and song “Let it Go” do not involve romantic love in the first place. While Snow White sings about a dream marriage proposal, and Pocahontas sings of a rejection of such concepts, Elsa's main number is about her own liberation and power. This takes the ideas of female independence and freedom a step above Pocahontas and a leap above Snow White. Many lines of the song lend to the ideas of female independence, power and even underlying tones of sexual liberation. From the first verse's “I couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried” to the second verse's “The fears that once controlled me, can't get to me at all” addresses the restrictions Elsa, and many females, have experienced through both historic and modern society's impossible standards for women. Elsa associates her power with fear and misunderstanding, but within this number we see not only acceptance, but celebration of being powerful. This also examines the danger of women living with such restrictions over their lives. Those restrictions only serve to create a sense of shame, fear and inequality from their male counterparts. “Let it Go” definitely ties us back to the ideas of sexual liberation through various undertones in the lyrics. The lyric that I believe sums up the entire idea of the song comes in the final chorus, “Let it go and I'll rise like the break of dawn, let it go That perfect girl is gone, here I stand in the light of day.” “That Perfect Girl is Gone” not only excellently sums up the message of this song and film, but of the entire idea that I’m researching. The strive for perfection and unrealistic standards of beauty, femininity and the roles women are “supposed” to play in society are harmful and effectively “let go.” While, Elsa shows us the harms when we try to abide by these outdated expectations of Snow White, she also exhibits the liberation experienced when they are let go and is free and liberated similar to Pocahontas and takes it a step further.\n\nWhile the strives the Disney studios have made in terms of their portrayals of female independence within their films has proven to be quite progressive, it’s important to note that even the most recent characters and films aren’t without issues in terms of gender relations and equality. While, as discussed, it’s healthy for female sexuality to be more freely expressed, there is a line to be drawn between portraying females that are confident with their sexuality and females designed simply for sex appeal. This isn’t to say that certain misguided decisions behind the scenes totally discredit the positive aspects of these characters. An interesting project that I have come across called the “RealPrincess” which I found to be an excellent example of putting pressure on Disney studios to expand even further with their feminist evolution. This project entailed girls drawing their version of “Real Princesses” which included princess who were either non-attractive, plus-sized, disabled, gay, transgender, and other aspects not yet explored by Disney. We’ve seen unattractive males as protagonists but all of the females have been relatively pretty. I would like to think conversations like this would encourage a mainstream and popular studio like Disney to display these people's different stories to their broad audience and would just hope that the audience would be receptive these different Princesses. However, if there is any criticism of this article, I would say that the strawman fallacy is utilized here by setting up these characters as easier to knock down. “One of the most nefarious aspects of the traditional Disney princess model is the stereotypical, hyper-feminine ideals their narratives promote” (Zellinger 3). The author seems to broadly generalize all of Disney's female protagonists by the older stereotype of helpless damsels in distress in order to further make their argument. I feel Pocahontas, Mulan and Elsa are important points of progression, although their role as relatively attractive females remain. It is important to keep a certain amount of pressure on our media to keep striving to improve the portrayals of females, however, it is also important to still offer praise and encouragement for improvements that we do see.\n\nThese three characters offer a glimpse into the overall evolution of female characters within Disney films. Putting them side by side we see how the portrayals of female liberation has gradually improved, results varying from a passive, naïve and virginal young girl to confident, strong willed and three-dimensional young women. It seems the further we venture into demonstrating complexity, independence and imperfections in females the closer we get to achieving the perfect female role model.\n\n### Works Cited\nEngland, D.

The princesses have littered young children’s bedrooms, theme parks and films for nearly a century and in turn have become a large topic of debate and observation. These conversations vary from praise to criticism; the focus has been on the ever-changing portrayal of female independence, strength and sexuality throughout the years. Snow White from the film <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</em> represents a positive portrayal of female repression and restriction, while Pocahontas from the film <em>Pocahontas</em> represents a positive portrayal of female freedom. Elsa from the film <em>Frozen</em> acts as a bridge between these two, looking to exhibit the dangers of female restrictions such as Snow White and the celebration of female liberation and freedom such as Pocahontas, which paints her as a three-dimensional heroine exhibiting this progression. However I look to argue that, despite popular opinions and social media reactions to <em>Frozen</em>, Elsa is definitely not the first female heroine to exhibit independence, a healthy sexual expression or strength. I would like to show how there has been a gradual linear progression of these aspects all along that has increasingly improved over time, rather than overnight. I look to make this argument by examining the expression of female sexuality and independence and how it has progressed over time in different ways through three Disney heroines.</p>\n<p>Our three heroines can be seen as examples of how females presented different stages of independence and sexual expression in film. Nearly eighty years ago we were introduced to the beautiful and innocent, yet passive Snow White. Displaying the beauty ideals of a young female and the part which she plays in society in her film, Snow White can be looked at as an example of how females were expected to be behave. Flash forward nearly fifty-seven years and we’re introduced to an entirely different type of heroine; the Native American Pocahontas proves to show a different side of what a female character can possibly be. An independent, free-spirited daydreamer, Pocahontas plays a much more active role in her life and is portrayed as a liberated and powerful character. In an icy blast we find ourselves in present day where just less than two years ago we were introduced to the Snow Queen of Arendelle. We see this character go from the villain of the original tale to a complex anti-hero of the final film. Not only does Elsa offer us a celebration of an independent and powerful female character, but she also the shows downfall of restricting such strengths.</p>\n<p>When we are discussing the roles a female character plays in relation to the stereotypical gender roles and the portrayal of her independence the female’s expression of sexuality is a pivotal plot point. In family films like these we usually see sexuality as an underlying theme, being expressed through various symbols and subtle characterizations. The expression of female sexuality has gone through many different steps to get to where we are today. Snow White is presented as the idealized patriarchal figure of what women should emulate: Snow White is non-sexual, conservative, naïve, innocent and passive. Her character design includes a long dress, a modest neckline, and hair done-up tightly while her body language can be described as modest, restricted and proper. All of these physical traits can easily play into the ideal of how women “should” think and behave. An important symbol in the film for sexuality is the apple. With the allusion to the temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden, Snow White’s apple symbolizes a sexual and deadly temptation, sending an underlying message of the “danger” of a female expressing her “sinful” sexuality. We see this apple offered by the only other female character. This further paints the image that all sin arises from the temptation of females (those who don’t emulate Snow White’s brand of innocence). Snow White effectively “dies” from even one taste of this “sin” only to be rescued by a man. I believe that this not only places Snow White in a helpless role, but also sends a message that sexuality is only appropriate or redeemable when it’s a male perpetrating the action.</p>\n<p>If we’re to compare Snow White to Pocahontas, it’s almost the complete opposite. Looking at character design we see Pocahontas as having a more curvy or sexualized image, with a short dress, an off-the-shoulder neckline, all completed with her hair down. Hair can act as a symbol for sexuality or expressive freedom. Specifically in that Snow White’s uptight, structured and modest hair style offers a glimpse into her conservative role concerning sexuality while Pocahontas’s raven hair frequently seen flowing in the wind can be looked at as more sexually liberated. Pocahontas also sports a tattoo, which would be hard to imagine on Snow White. Tattoos in literature are often symbols of individuality or freedom of expression. This sense of freedom is very important in her characterization. “Pocahontas has her mother’s spirit, she goes wherever the wind takes her” are the first words spoken of her. Her character is also frequently seen running and jumping throughout the film, a clear contrast from Snow White’s reserved body language. This introduction to her character paints her as a free-spirited woman living without the restrictions of characters like Snow White. However, the aspect of her more sexual image that is holding this character back from being fully progressive is arguably the fact that her sexual expression is still very much in relation to the entertainment of the male gaze. This is due to her story being based around her male relationships and the attention she receives from men. There’s a thin line between designing a sexually confident and expressive female character and designing a female character placing emphasis on “sex appeal.” I believe Pocahontas certainly walks this line which potentially hinders her progression and independence by still placing some of her sexual expression on the dependence on men.</p>\n<p>We observe the character Queen Elsa as she brings our ideas here full circle. I believe Elsa offers a middle ground between these two ideas. These are presented in the initial portrayal of her conservative and restricted nature similar to Snow White to her eventual liberation and freedom of Pocahontas. Elsa’s character design includes two different dresses. Her first, more conservative style includes an tightly done up hairstyle akin to Snow White. She sports a floor length dress, cape and symbolic gloves. Gloves in literature and films often symbolize the concealing of true motives, desires, sexuality or power. The gloves are ripped off both figuratively and literally during her transition to her next style. Her second dress is not just a pretty dress but offers a glimpse at symbolism for female sexuality. This style includes an icy blue dress with a slit in the leg, which hints at an openness towards female sexuality, and a long icy cape. During this transition we also see her undoing her hair in a dramatic fashion, figuratively and literally “letting her hair down,” similarly changing from Snow White’s up-do to Pocahontas’s freely flowing locks. In addition, we see many instances of body language playing into this symbolic embracing of female sexuality. During this change we see Elsa swinging her hips and freely throwing her arms up while “letting it go.” What I believe is most important here is that  this act of sexual liberation doesn’t have to be in position to entertain a man. Arguably, we couldn’t say this for Pocahontas whose story still very much places emphasis on men. Too often female sexuality, when it’s not condemned, is looked at as something that’s sole purpose is for the pleasing of men, as we see here that there was no John Smith or Prince Charming character for which she felt the need to impress. She never even has any sort of male love interest in the film at all, this symbolic sexual liberation takes place when she is completely by herself. This further shows Elsa’s sexual liberation coming from her accepting who she is and the powers she has. Female sexual liberation or expression can and should be born out of one’s own self-confidence and independence rather than being centered around male attention. It’s also important to observe the stages from shame to celebration through the portrayal of her initial conservative and fearful mindset to her eventual liberation and fearlessness. At the beginning we see many instances of the dangers of holding oneself back. She sings, “Be the good girl you always have to be, conceal, don’t feel, put on a show.” Many girls in society before and even today are commonly raised to sit down and be quiet and to not be open with one’s sexuality the ways boys are. We see through Elsa just how a woman can be negatively affected by being taught these things and “putting on a show.” I believe that her powers over ice and snow represent something more than just a magical aspect of the film. The way this magic is treated seems to symbolize female sexuality; it’s something beautiful and completely natural, but is shunned and shamed. Her parents forcing her to wear gloves to conceal her supernatural powers further shows this type of restriction she has been taught. So much so that when her true self is finally revealed, she reacts with fear and shame, showcasing the dangers of these strict standards and restrictions. However, her liberation and independence is celebrated, becoming a pivotal point in the film. The song “Let it Go” can be analyzed as having an underlying sexual liberation theme. The embracing of female freedom and sexuality and the rejection of strict regulations offer a much better and healthier message to audiences rather than the promotion of female conservativeness, innocence and non-sexuality. The repression of one’s sexuality due to societal expectations is shown in this film as a dangerous mindset. Her icy powers only caused her trouble when she had this mindset.</p>\n<p>Concerning sexuality and gender roles, the role that romance plays and the role of the men opposite these women offers an obvious relation. In the film <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</em>, Snow White meets her love interest, a nameless prince, and immediately falls in love. We have seen how Snow White is an idealized image of what a woman was supposed to be, and here she assumes one of the “acceptable” roles a woman could hold, that of the wife. The archetype of the Damsel in Distress is present within the character of Snow White. We see the Prince as the Hero, saving Snow White, who’s rendered helpless until he kisses her. I believe that this entire scene shows her role of sexuality being condemned. As discussed before, the sexual symbol of the apple puts her in a sleeping death, which is only redeemed when the male comes and plays the active role. Despite the themes that this story seems to promote, placing full dependence on love or a man to save your life is simply not a healthy way to live.</p>\n<p>The film <em>Pocahontas</em> introduces us to the fictitious romance between Powhatan Princess Pocahontas and English Explorer John Smith. Their love story offers a much more complex pairing versus Snow White and her nameless rent-a-prince. The gender roles of this love story, especially compared to Snow White seem to be counter-stereotypical. An interesting study done by Dawn England examined each movie and describes each instance of these Disney characters exhibiting stereotypical “masculine” and “feminine” gender roles. This study observed the masculine traits in characters, examples involve such stereotypical male traits in fairy tales ranging from brave to violent. Conversely the feminine traits taken into consideration in this study include things like docile or gentleness. According to England’s study, Pocahontas exhibits 105 “masculine” versus 130 “feminine,” this is much closer to equal than Snow White exhibiting only 13 instances of the masculine gender role, and 137 feminine (558). This is a stark contrast that statistically shows the difference between Snow White and Pocahontas’ relation to gender roles, which heavily reflects upon their roles in their romances. A prime example of this reversal of gender roles is seen upon John Smith’s near execution. As we see, it is Pocahontas who is throwing her body over John, willing to sacrifice her own life for his. This places Pocahontas in a position of power and dominance and John Smith in a role of helplessness, effectively eliminating that aspect of the damsel in distress motif. The woman is no longer needs to be saved but she is now the savior. Also unlike her poison apple eating predecessor, I have found that Pocahontas takes the notion that she “needs to be saved” as an insult. This is seen in an earlier scene when John Smith tells Pocahontas how he and his fellow Englishmen have “improved the lives of savages everywhere” to which she takes obvious insult. This negative reaction to needing to be saved is important to note in discussions of the “female needing rescue” motif. Another major difference in the love story of this film is in its ending. Upon John Smith needing to return to England he extends Pocahontas an invitation to join him but she declines.  While the film is ultimately based upon romance, Pocahontas is no damsel in distress, and places her priority on her family and her people rather than chasing romantic love, further painting her as a strong woman independent from men. Unlike Snow White, she does not assume the “acceptable” role as a man’s wife. I believe all of these things go to show that romantic relations do not always have to act as a hindrance to female strength and that there is power of family over romance, both of which are further expanded upon in later films.</p>\n<p>Taking this evolution a step above Pocahontas, for the first time our heroine, Elsa, never has a love interest at all. In fact there is little to no mention of Elsa’s romantic life in the film. Her story simply does not need to involve a man; her emotions, motives and aspirations are more than complex enough to tell a story. While a female’s romantic relationships don’t have to be a threat to her characterization, it’s important to show a heroine whose story doesn’t have to involve such themes in the first place. This is an obvious intentional message to send, and is where Elsa comes in a step above Pocahontas. However, Elsa’s relationship to other men concerning her role as a woman is still important to her story. I observe Elsa as a symbol of a threat to male power. Upon the revelation of her magic, she’s immediately demonized mostly by the men around her. It’s also important to note that this revelation takes place during Elsa’s coronation as queen. She’s already literally displaying her political power as queen, to which certain characters look to exploit. Specifically the character of The Duke of Weaselton, thinking out loud upon entering the palace he says “Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches!” This is why Elsa’s powers are so frightening to him: he proclaims Elsa as a “monster” because she has a power, which he doesn’t understand and therefore cannot effectively control. She has the ability to do something that’s out of the control of men and that scares them. Their only chance is to try to tear her down by demonizing her magic. Historically, this theme is exemplified with many “Witch Hunts” throughout history, where, due to a fear of women gaining power, many girls would be falsely accused of evil magic. It’s not a coincidence that “evil” witches are stereotypically female. Elsa’s overcoming of this patriarchal demonization of her supernatural and political power proves to be a dire aspect in the film. As we see, unlike Snow White, men can be, and often are, the very source of the main conflict rather than the solution.</p>\n<p>When observing a female character’s independence from men it’s important to observe the nature of the relationships she forms with fellow women. Many female relationships too often fall to the sidelines, or into one category; competition. When fellow women are seen only as competition for male affection it severely hinders her independence. Just like Snow White’s only female-to-female relationship with the Evil Queen. “Since physical appearance has traditionally been the most valuable asset for a woman, beauty makes her eligible for marriage, it should come as no surprise that anyone considered superior in beauty is an enemy that must be destroyed.” (González). We see this as an example in the Evil Queen’s vice being born out of her envy of Snow White being “Fairest of them all”. As González indicates, this motive is a result of the importance society has–and still–places on female beauty and attractiveness. Expanding upon this idea, the Queen’s vanity and evilness play into one of only two categories most female characters fell into. Usually a female character was either the good “virgin” or the evil “whore.” González describes the Queen in relation to this “virgin-whore motif as, “The old, fallen woman, as the representation of the world of experience from which the heroine must be preserved, is introduced as a threat to the eternal state of innocence in which a woman is expected to remain” (204). It would seem that a woman who doesn’t remain in a state of innocence or male dependence is a menace. To expand on this idea, I observe the intention of these characterizations is for the audience to be conditioned to see Snow White’s innocence and dependence on a man as a positive aspects and, as discussed before, ideals for how women were supposed to act, while the Queen’s independence, power, and lack of a King is portrayed along with negativity, jealousy and evilness, how a woman was expected to oppose. This paints female independence as something that can only be seen in one who is threatening and harmful. This “Virgin versus Whore” motif proves to be overall problematic as it overly simplifies the portrayal of what a woman could be in film and society and demonizes females with power independent from men.</p>\n<p>While Snow White’s only female-to-female exchange came in the form of a deadly competition with a jealous queen, we see Pocahontas forming positive and rewarding relationships with other females. Pocahontas’s very first interaction within her film is with her female best friend, Nakoma. The nature of their relationship is not one of rivalry or competition for a man’s affection, but rather of protection and mutual support. Upon learning of Pocahontas’s relationship with a white settler, Nakoma’s reaction does not include any jealousy or rivalry but rather she caringly and concerningly grabs her hand and says, “Pocahontas, please. You’re my best friend. I don’t want you to get hurt.” The caring nature of her best friend lends to the idea that females can and should protect and build each other up, rather than tear each other down in the name of a man.  I believe this relationship was written to further show that female characters only motives don’t have to involve male affection. However, we often see Pocahontas not listening to Nakoma’s caring voice of reason, and we still see this relationship as secondary to the romance and too often falls to the sidelines in favor of her relationship with a man. The historical figure of Pocahontas offers many interesting stories and lessons yet the film and design of her character definitely gravitate towards her male relationships. While this female relationship is positively portrayed and rewarding, we don’t see female-to-female bonds as a focus of a film until 2013’s Frozen.</p>\n<p>The relationship Elsa has with her sister Anna is important because it is the main course of the film rather than a side dish. It shows the strength of the sisterly bond has in place of romantic bonds. One aspect of their relationship that comes into play when discussing the ideals of feminism within the film is their differing views of romance. Elsa responds to Anna’s engagement by saying, “What do you understand about true love? You can’t marry a man you just met,” effectively crushing the dreams of the majority of her fellow Disney princesses. This viewpoint proves to be quite useful as the character whom Anna wished to marry, Hans, is revealed to be the true antagonist of the film. I believe this twist serves to show the fault of the “love at first sight” motif that is all too common in fairy tales. It’s not always a good idea to wed the first guy who sings a duet with you. Sure, in real life maybe he won’t try to kill you and your sister and take your kingdom, but Elsa’s maturity and caring for her sister in this situation further paints her as a powerful and independent female role model. In fact, the “act of true love” comes from their sisterly bond, rather than a man. This aspect of their relationship is crucial. We see Anna sacrificing herself to save Elsa’s life from the man she was almost ready to marry. However, not only does her act of sacrifice manage to save Elsa’s life, it has in turn saved Anna’s as her frozen heart begins to thaw. They have effectively saved each other’s lives without the help of Prince Charming. The hero-damsel motif isn’t just reversed, it is dismantled in this example. We have seen <em>Snow White’s</em> conflict a result of a female and her solution coming from a man saving the girl. In <em>Pocahontas</em> we then see the girl being the one to save the man. However with <em>Frozen</em> we see the problem stemming from men and a female-to-female bond being the ultimate solution. The film’s entire main focus being on the power of strong female relationships and independence from men is an excellent example of the evolution from the days of poison apples.</p>\n<p> To expand on this traditionally negative connotation of female independence, I believe we see Elsa have more in common with the female villains of the past, such as the Evil Queen, rather than the supposed heroines: “Female independence has traditionally been perceived as a menace for the order established by patriarchal society, A woman who decides not to adapt herself to the traditional roles is seen as going against what nature has intended for her” (González 203).  If we are to draw a comparison between The Snow Queen of 2013 and The Evil Queen of 1937, it is easy to identify the evolution. They both hold absolute monarch political power without a king; They both practice some sort of supernatural magic; They are both powerful, independent and misunderstood and shunned by their community. However, the portrayal of Elsa as a protagonist rather than an antagonist is crucial. The Evil Queen is written as a purely evil villain, demonized by both the audience and producers, as González has mentioned. While Elsa is portrayed as heroic and misunderstood, feeling the negative effects of such attitudes held by the men in her world against female power and independence. An important comparison to draw upon is the use of the word “fool.” This word has become a favorite amongst villains such as Maleficent and the Evil Queen, often used to demean their henchmen or the protagonist. However Elsa uses it in a different way. “I’m such a fool, I can’t be free” she sings. The only difference here is Elsa is directing the word at herself rather than others, tying her to the villain the men in the world lead her to believe she is. It shows a sort of internalized self-criticism taught to girls who dare to exhibit the independence, power, or differences traditionally portrayed by villains. Another aspect that is pivotal to their understanding is the intended reaction for these characters from their respective audiences. The audience of 1937’s <em>Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs</em> is lead to see the powerful and independent female as a threat, with negative intentions, wicked jealousy and disregard. However, the audience of 2013’s <em>Frozen</em> is lead to see this powerful and independent female as a misunderstood hero, one who takes control of her own destiny and sets a good example. Female independence doesn’t have to come from jealous and evil villains, but can and should be born out of heroines. One may argue that with the female villains, Disney has been portraying strong and independent females all along. However, I would argue that there is an underlying negative message in portraying these things in antagonists. It would seem as though it is saying that females exhibiting these strengths and powers are doomed to be defeated, and receive an unhappy ending. While powerless and weaker female characters are the ones that receive, or “deserve” a happy ending. When self-sufficiency, sexuality and strength in female characters is only shown in the evil villains it provides an overall negative connotation to an audience of impressionable young kids. This makes protagonists displaying these traits all the more important.</p>\n<p>Music plays an important role, not only in the plot development, but also in offering a look into the messages of the films as well. Snow White sings the song “Someday My Prince Will Come.” The title itself lends to the passive dependence women were expected to take within romance and life that we have previously discussed. In the present day it is easy to see how this message doesn’t exactly work. Taken directly from the piece, “Wedding bells will ring, Someday when my dreams come true”. This presents the idea that a woman’s “dreams coming true” usually only involving “wedding bells ringing”. The way this idea is presented in the song is as if the only acceptable dream for women is being a wife dependent on males, which goes back to Snow White’s overall portrayal being based upon the strict standards and ideals society had for females.</p>\n<p>In Pocahontas’ “Just Around the Riverbend,” “Pocahontas’ dissatisfaction subverts the conventions of previous Disney songs” (Zarranz 58). This song presents her dissatisfaction with another character, Kocoum’s, marriage proposal. Pocahontas sings that she “ignores the sound of distant drumming” for a “handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls.” Along with this contrast, another interesting example of this subversion is in lyrics, from Snow White’s “Dreams Coming True” when “Wedding Bells Ring,” to Pocahontas singing “Should I Marry Kocoum? Is All My Dreaming at an End?” This direct contrast not only paints a woman’s dreams as something more than just finding a handsome, sturdy husband, but also showing that it could in fact signal the end of her dreams. So while Snow White exhibits the idealized and ultimately outdated and harmful concept that a woman’s wedding is the pinnacle of her life, Pocahontas exhibits the opposite. This song rather paints marriage as something she is dreading, rather than dreaming of. The song also paints Pocahontas as a very active part of her love life. While Snow White may sit at the riverbank waiting for high tide to bring in whatever prince she sings a duet with first, Pocahontas jumps right in, listens to her heart and wants to make her own decisions in her romantic life.</p>\n<p>Just like discussed previously, Elsa’s story and song “Let it Go” do not involve romantic love in the first place. While Snow White sings about a dream marriage proposal, and Pocahontas sings of a rejection of such concepts, Elsa’s main number is about her own liberation and power. This takes the ideas of female independence and freedom a step above Pocahontas and a leap above Snow White. Many lines of the song lend to the ideas of female independence, power and even underlying tones of sexual liberation. From the first verse’s “I couldn’t keep it in, heaven knows I tried” to the second verse’s “The fears that once controlled me, can’t get to me at all” addresses the restrictions Elsa, and many females, have experienced through both historic and modern society’s impossible standards for women. Elsa associates her power with fear and misunderstanding, but within this number we see not only acceptance, but celebration of being powerful. This also examines the danger of women living with such restrictions over their lives. Those restrictions only serve to create a sense of shame, fear and inequality from their male counterparts. “Let it Go” definitely ties us back to the ideas of sexual liberation through various undertones in the lyrics. The lyric that I believe sums up the entire idea of the song comes in the final chorus, “Let it go and I’ll rise like the break of dawn, let it go That perfect girl is gone, here I stand in the light of day.” “That Perfect Girl is Gone” not only excellently sums up the message of this song and film, but of the entire idea that I’m researching. The strive for perfection and unrealistic standards of beauty, femininity and the roles women are “supposed” to play in society are harmful and effectively “let go.” While, Elsa shows us the harms when we try to abide by these outdated expectations of Snow White, she also exhibits the liberation experienced when they are let go and is free and liberated similar to Pocahontas and takes it a step further.</p>\n<p>While the strives the Disney studios have made in terms of their portrayals of female independence within their films has proven to be quite progressive, it’s important to note that even the most recent characters and films aren’t without issues in terms of gender relations and equality. While, as discussed, it’s healthy for female sexuality to be more freely expressed, there is a line to be drawn between portraying females that are confident with their sexuality and females designed simply for sex appeal. This isn’t to say that certain misguided decisions behind the scenes totally discredit the positive aspects of these characters. An interesting project that I have come across called the “RealPrincess” which I found to be an excellent example of putting pressure on Disney studios to expand even further with their feminist evolution. This project entailed girls drawing their version of “Real Princesses” which included princess who were either non-attractive, plus-sized, disabled, gay, transgender, and other aspects not yet explored by Disney. We’ve seen unattractive males as protagonists but all of the females have been relatively pretty. I would like to think conversations like this would encourage a mainstream and popular studio like Disney to display these people’s different stories to their broad audience and would just hope that the audience would be receptive these different Princesses. However, if there is any criticism of this article, I would say that the strawman fallacy is utilized here by setting up these characters as easier to knock down. “One of the most nefarious aspects of the traditional Disney princess model is the stereotypical, hyper-feminine ideals their narratives promote” (Zellinger 3). The author seems to broadly generalize all of Disney’s female protagonists by the older stereotype of helpless damsels in distress in order to further make their argument. I feel Pocahontas, Mulan and Elsa are important points of progression, although their role as relatively attractive females remain. It is important to keep a certain amount of pressure on our media to keep striving to improve the portrayals of females, however, it is also important to still offer praise and encouragement for improvements that we do see.</p>\n<p>These three characters offer a glimpse into the overall evolution of female characters within Disney films. Putting them side by side we see how the portrayals of female liberation has gradually improved, results varying from a passive, naïve and virginal young girl to confident, strong willed and three-dimensional young women. It seems the further we venture into demonstrating complexity, independence and imperfections in females the closer we get to achieving the perfect female role model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Works-Cited\"><a href=\"#Works-Cited\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Works Cited\"></a>Works Cited</h3><p>England, D.

The princesses have littered young children’s bedrooms, theme parks and films for nearly a century and in turn have become a large topic of debate and observation. These conversations vary from praise to criticism; the focus has been on the ever-changing portrayal of female independence, strength and sexuality throughout the years. Snow White from the film <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</em> represents a positive portrayal of female repression and restriction, while Pocahontas from the film <em>Pocahontas</em> represents a positive portrayal of female freedom. Elsa from the film <em>Frozen</em> acts as a bridge between these two, looking to exhibit the dangers of female restrictions such as Snow White and the celebration of female liberation and freedom such as Pocahontas, which paints her as a three-dimensional heroine exhibiting this progression. However I look to argue that, despite popular opinions and social media reactions to <em>Frozen</em>, Elsa is definitely not the first female heroine to exhibit independence, a healthy sexual expression or strength. I would like to show how there has been a gradual linear progression of these aspects all along that has increasingly improved over time, rather than overnight. I look to make this argument by examining the expression of female sexuality and independence and how it has progressed over time in different ways through three Disney heroines.</p>\n<p>Our three heroines can be seen as examples of how females presented different stages of independence and sexual expression in film. Nearly eighty years ago we were introduced to the beautiful and innocent, yet passive Snow White. Displaying the beauty ideals of a young female and the part which she plays in society in her film, Snow White can be looked at as an example of how females were expected to be behave. Flash forward nearly fifty-seven years and we’re introduced to an entirely different type of heroine; the Native American Pocahontas proves to show a different side of what a female character can possibly be. An independent, free-spirited daydreamer, Pocahontas plays a much more active role in her life and is portrayed as a liberated and powerful character. In an icy blast we find ourselves in present day where just less than two years ago we were introduced to the Snow Queen of Arendelle. We see this character go from the villain of the original tale to a complex anti-hero of the final film. Not only does Elsa offer us a celebration of an independent and powerful female character, but she also the shows downfall of restricting such strengths.</p>\n<p>When we are discussing the roles a female character plays in relation to the stereotypical gender roles and the portrayal of her independence the female’s expression of sexuality is a pivotal plot point. In family films like these we usually see sexuality as an underlying theme, being expressed through various symbols and subtle characterizations. The expression of female sexuality has gone through many different steps to get to where we are today. Snow White is presented as the idealized patriarchal figure of what women should emulate: Snow White is non-sexual, conservative, naïve, innocent and passive. Her character design includes a long dress, a modest neckline, and hair done-up tightly while her body language can be described as modest, restricted and proper. All of these physical traits can easily play into the ideal of how women “should” think and behave. An important symbol in the film for sexuality is the apple. With the allusion to the temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden, Snow White’s apple symbolizes a sexual and deadly temptation, sending an underlying message of the “danger” of a female expressing her “sinful” sexuality. We see this apple offered by the only other female character. This further paints the image that all sin arises from the temptation of females (those who don’t emulate Snow White’s brand of innocence). Snow White effectively “dies” from even one taste of this “sin” only to be rescued by a man. I believe that this not only places Snow White in a helpless role, but also sends a message that sexuality is only appropriate or redeemable when it’s a male perpetrating the action.</p>\n<p>If we’re to compare Snow White to Pocahontas, it’s almost the complete opposite. Looking at character design we see Pocahontas as having a more curvy or sexualized image, with a short dress, an off-the-shoulder neckline, all completed with her hair down. Hair can act as a symbol for sexuality or expressive freedom. Specifically in that Snow White’s uptight, structured and modest hair style offers a glimpse into her conservative role concerning sexuality while Pocahontas’s raven hair frequently seen flowing in the wind can be looked at as more sexually liberated. Pocahontas also sports a tattoo, which would be hard to imagine on Snow White. Tattoos in literature are often symbols of individuality or freedom of expression. This sense of freedom is very important in her characterization. “Pocahontas has her mother’s spirit, she goes wherever the wind takes her” are the first words spoken of her. Her character is also frequently seen running and jumping throughout the film, a clear contrast from Snow White’s reserved body language. This introduction to her character paints her as a free-spirited woman living without the restrictions of characters like Snow White. However, the aspect of her more sexual image that is holding this character back from being fully progressive is arguably the fact that her sexual expression is still very much in relation to the entertainment of the male gaze. This is due to her story being based around her male relationships and the attention she receives from men. There’s a thin line between designing a sexually confident and expressive female character and designing a female character placing emphasis on “sex appeal.” I believe Pocahontas certainly walks this line which potentially hinders her progression and independence by still placing some of her sexual expression on the dependence on men.</p>\n<p>We observe the character Queen Elsa as she brings our ideas here full circle. I believe Elsa offers a middle ground between these two ideas. These are presented in the initial portrayal of her conservative and restricted nature similar to Snow White to her eventual liberation and freedom of Pocahontas. Elsa’s character design includes two different dresses. Her first, more conservative style includes an tightly done up hairstyle akin to Snow White. She sports a floor length dress, cape and symbolic gloves. Gloves in literature and films often symbolize the concealing of true motives, desires, sexuality or power. The gloves are ripped off both figuratively and literally during her transition to her next style. Her second dress is not just a pretty dress but offers a glimpse at symbolism for female sexuality. This style includes an icy blue dress with a slit in the leg, which hints at an openness towards female sexuality, and a long icy cape. During this transition we also see her undoing her hair in a dramatic fashion, figuratively and literally “letting her hair down,” similarly changing from Snow White’s up-do to Pocahontas’s freely flowing locks. In addition, we see many instances of body language playing into this symbolic embracing of female sexuality. During this change we see Elsa swinging her hips and freely throwing her arms up while “letting it go.” What I believe is most important here is that  this act of sexual liberation doesn’t have to be in position to entertain a man. Arguably, we couldn’t say this for Pocahontas whose story still very much places emphasis on men. Too often female sexuality, when it’s not condemned, is looked at as something that’s sole purpose is for the pleasing of men, as we see here that there was no John Smith or Prince Charming character for which she felt the need to impress. She never even has any sort of male love interest in the film at all, this symbolic sexual liberation takes place when she is completely by herself. This further shows Elsa’s sexual liberation coming from her accepting who she is and the powers she has. Female sexual liberation or expression can and should be born out of one’s own self-confidence and independence rather than being centered around male attention. It’s also important to observe the stages from shame to celebration through the portrayal of her initial conservative and fearful mindset to her eventual liberation and fearlessness. At the beginning we see many instances of the dangers of holding oneself back. She sings, “Be the good girl you always have to be, conceal, don’t feel, put on a show.” Many girls in society before and even today are commonly raised to sit down and be quiet and to not be open with one’s sexuality the ways boys are. We see through Elsa just how a woman can be negatively affected by being taught these things and “putting on a show.” I believe that her powers over ice and snow represent something more than just a magical aspect of the film. The way this magic is treated seems to symbolize female sexuality; it’s something beautiful and completely natural, but is shunned and shamed. Her parents forcing her to wear gloves to conceal her supernatural powers further shows this type of restriction she has been taught. So much so that when her true self is finally revealed, she reacts with fear and shame, showcasing the dangers of these strict standards and restrictions. However, her liberation and independence is celebrated, becoming a pivotal point in the film. The song “Let it Go” can be analyzed as having an underlying sexual liberation theme. The embracing of female freedom and sexuality and the rejection of strict regulations offer a much better and healthier message to audiences rather than the promotion of female conservativeness, innocence and non-sexuality. The repression of one’s sexuality due to societal expectations is shown in this film as a dangerous mindset. Her icy powers only caused her trouble when she had this mindset.</p>\n<p>Concerning sexuality and gender roles, the role that romance plays and the role of the men opposite these women offers an obvious relation. In the film <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</em>, Snow White meets her love interest, a nameless prince, and immediately falls in love. We have seen how Snow White is an idealized image of what a woman was supposed to be, and here she assumes one of the “acceptable” roles a woman could hold, that of the wife. The archetype of the Damsel in Distress is present within the character of Snow White. We see the Prince as the Hero, saving Snow White, who’s rendered helpless until he kisses her. I believe that this entire scene shows her role of sexuality being condemned. As discussed before, the sexual symbol of the apple puts her in a sleeping death, which is only redeemed when the male comes and plays the active role. Despite the themes that this story seems to promote, placing full dependence on love or a man to save your life is simply not a healthy way to live.</p>\n<p>The film <em>Pocahontas</em> introduces us to the fictitious romance between Powhatan Princess Pocahontas and English Explorer John Smith. Their love story offers a much more complex pairing versus Snow White and her nameless rent-a-prince. The gender roles of this love story, especially compared to Snow White seem to be counter-stereotypical. An interesting study done by Dawn England examined each movie and describes each instance of these Disney characters exhibiting stereotypical “masculine” and “feminine” gender roles. This study observed the masculine traits in characters, examples involve such stereotypical male traits in fairy tales ranging from brave to violent. Conversely the feminine traits taken into consideration in this study include things like docile or gentleness. According to England’s study, Pocahontas exhibits 105 “masculine” versus 130 “feminine,” this is much closer to equal than Snow White exhibiting only 13 instances of the masculine gender role, and 137 feminine (558). This is a stark contrast that statistically shows the difference between Snow White and Pocahontas’ relation to gender roles, which heavily reflects upon their roles in their romances. A prime example of this reversal of gender roles is seen upon John Smith’s near execution. As we see, it is Pocahontas who is throwing her body over John, willing to sacrifice her own life for his. This places Pocahontas in a position of power and dominance and John Smith in a role of helplessness, effectively eliminating that aspect of the damsel in distress motif. The woman is no longer needs to be saved but she is now the savior. Also unlike her poison apple eating predecessor, I have found that Pocahontas takes the notion that she “needs to be saved” as an insult. This is seen in an earlier scene when John Smith tells Pocahontas how he and his fellow Englishmen have “improved the lives of savages everywhere” to which she takes obvious insult. This negative reaction to needing to be saved is important to note in discussions of the “female needing rescue” motif. Another major difference in the love story of this film is in its ending. Upon John Smith needing to return to England he extends Pocahontas an invitation to join him but she declines.  While the film is ultimately based upon romance, Pocahontas is no damsel in distress, and places her priority on her family and her people rather than chasing romantic love, further painting her as a strong woman independent from men. Unlike Snow White, she does not assume the “acceptable” role as a man’s wife. I believe all of these things go to show that romantic relations do not always have to act as a hindrance to female strength and that there is power of family over romance, both of which are further expanded upon in later films.</p>\n<p>Taking this evolution a step above Pocahontas, for the first time our heroine, Elsa, never has a love interest at all. In fact there is little to no mention of Elsa’s romantic life in the film. Her story simply does not need to involve a man; her emotions, motives and aspirations are more than complex enough to tell a story. While a female’s romantic relationships don’t have to be a threat to her characterization, it’s important to show a heroine whose story doesn’t have to involve such themes in the first place. This is an obvious intentional message to send, and is where Elsa comes in a step above Pocahontas. However, Elsa’s relationship to other men concerning her role as a woman is still important to her story. I observe Elsa as a symbol of a threat to male power. Upon the revelation of her magic, she’s immediately demonized mostly by the men around her. It’s also important to note that this revelation takes place during Elsa’s coronation as queen. She’s already literally displaying her political power as queen, to which certain characters look to exploit. Specifically the character of The Duke of Weaselton, thinking out loud upon entering the palace he says “Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches!” This is why Elsa’s powers are so frightening to him: he proclaims Elsa as a “monster” because she has a power, which he doesn’t understand and therefore cannot effectively control. She has the ability to do something that’s out of the control of men and that scares them. Their only chance is to try to tear her down by demonizing her magic. Historically, this theme is exemplified with many “Witch Hunts” throughout history, where, due to a fear of women gaining power, many girls would be falsely accused of evil magic. It’s not a coincidence that “evil” witches are stereotypically female. Elsa’s overcoming of this patriarchal demonization of her supernatural and political power proves to be a dire aspect in the film. As we see, unlike Snow White, men can be, and often are, the very source of the main conflict rather than the solution.</p>\n<p>When observing a female character’s independence from men it’s important to observe the nature of the relationships she forms with fellow women. Many female relationships too often fall to the sidelines, or into one category; competition. When fellow women are seen only as competition for male affection it severely hinders her independence. Just like Snow White’s only female-to-female relationship with the Evil Queen. “Since physical appearance has traditionally been the most valuable asset for a woman, beauty makes her eligible for marriage, it should come as no surprise that anyone considered superior in beauty is an enemy that must be destroyed.” (González). We see this as an example in the Evil Queen’s vice being born out of her envy of Snow White being “Fairest of them all”. As González indicates, this motive is a result of the importance society has–and still–places on female beauty and attractiveness. Expanding upon this idea, the Queen’s vanity and evilness play into one of only two categories most female characters fell into. Usually a female character was either the good “virgin” or the evil “whore.” González describes the Queen in relation to this “virgin-whore motif as, “The old, fallen woman, as the representation of the world of experience from which the heroine must be preserved, is introduced as a threat to the eternal state of innocence in which a woman is expected to remain” (204). It would seem that a woman who doesn’t remain in a state of innocence or male dependence is a menace. To expand on this idea, I observe the intention of these characterizations is for the audience to be conditioned to see Snow White’s innocence and dependence on a man as a positive aspects and, as discussed before, ideals for how women were supposed to act, while the Queen’s independence, power, and lack of a King is portrayed along with negativity, jealousy and evilness, how a woman was expected to oppose. This paints female independence as something that can only be seen in one who is threatening and harmful. This “Virgin versus Whore” motif proves to be overall problematic as it overly simplifies the portrayal of what a woman could be in film and society and demonizes females with power independent from men.</p>\n<p>While Snow White’s only female-to-female exchange came in the form of a deadly competition with a jealous queen, we see Pocahontas forming positive and rewarding relationships with other females. Pocahontas’s very first interaction within her film is with her female best friend, Nakoma. The nature of their relationship is not one of rivalry or competition for a man’s affection, but rather of protection and mutual support. Upon learning of Pocahontas’s relationship with a white settler, Nakoma’s reaction does not include any jealousy or rivalry but rather she caringly and concerningly grabs her hand and says, “Pocahontas, please. You’re my best friend. I don’t want you to get hurt.” The caring nature of her best friend lends to the idea that females can and should protect and build each other up, rather than tear each other down in the name of a man.  I believe this relationship was written to further show that female characters only motives don’t have to involve male affection. However, we often see Pocahontas not listening to Nakoma’s caring voice of reason, and we still see this relationship as secondary to the romance and too often falls to the sidelines in favor of her relationship with a man. The historical figure of Pocahontas offers many interesting stories and lessons yet the film and design of her character definitely gravitate towards her male relationships. While this female relationship is positively portrayed and rewarding, we don’t see female-to-female bonds as a focus of a film until 2013’s Frozen.</p>\n<p>The relationship Elsa has with her sister Anna is important because it is the main course of the film rather than a side dish. It shows the strength of the sisterly bond has in place of romantic bonds. One aspect of their relationship that comes into play when discussing the ideals of feminism within the film is their differing views of romance. Elsa responds to Anna’s engagement by saying, “What do you understand about true love? You can’t marry a man you just met,” effectively crushing the dreams of the majority of her fellow Disney princesses. This viewpoint proves to be quite useful as the character whom Anna wished to marry, Hans, is revealed to be the true antagonist of the film. I believe this twist serves to show the fault of the “love at first sight” motif that is all too common in fairy tales. It’s not always a good idea to wed the first guy who sings a duet with you. Sure, in real life maybe he won’t try to kill you and your sister and take your kingdom, but Elsa’s maturity and caring for her sister in this situation further paints her as a powerful and independent female role model. In fact, the “act of true love” comes from their sisterly bond, rather than a man. This aspect of their relationship is crucial. We see Anna sacrificing herself to save Elsa’s life from the man she was almost ready to marry. However, not only does her act of sacrifice manage to save Elsa’s life, it has in turn saved Anna’s as her frozen heart begins to thaw. They have effectively saved each other’s lives without the help of Prince Charming. The hero-damsel motif isn’t just reversed, it is dismantled in this example. We have seen <em>Snow White’s</em> conflict a result of a female and her solution coming from a man saving the girl. In <em>Pocahontas</em> we then see the girl being the one to save the man. However with <em>Frozen</em> we see the problem stemming from men and a female-to-female bond being the ultimate solution. The film’s entire main focus being on the power of strong female relationships and independence from men is an excellent example of the evolution from the days of poison apples.</p>\n<p> To expand on this traditionally negative connotation of female independence, I believe we see Elsa have more in common with the female villains of the past, such as the Evil Queen, rather than the supposed heroines: “Female independence has traditionally been perceived as a menace for the order established by patriarchal society, A woman who decides not to adapt herself to the traditional roles is seen as going against what nature has intended for her” (González 203).  If we are to draw a comparison between The Snow Queen of 2013 and The Evil Queen of 1937, it is easy to identify the evolution. They both hold absolute monarch political power without a king; They both practice some sort of supernatural magic; They are both powerful, independent and misunderstood and shunned by their community. However, the portrayal of Elsa as a protagonist rather than an antagonist is crucial. The Evil Queen is written as a purely evil villain, demonized by both the audience and producers, as González has mentioned. While Elsa is portrayed as heroic and misunderstood, feeling the negative effects of such attitudes held by the men in her world against female power and independence. An important comparison to draw upon is the use of the word “fool.” This word has become a favorite amongst villains such as Maleficent and the Evil Queen, often used to demean their henchmen or the protagonist. However Elsa uses it in a different way. “I’m such a fool, I can’t be free” she sings. The only difference here is Elsa is directing the word at herself rather than others, tying her to the villain the men in the world lead her to believe she is. It shows a sort of internalized self-criticism taught to girls who dare to exhibit the independence, power, or differences traditionally portrayed by villains. Another aspect that is pivotal to their understanding is the intended reaction for these characters from their respective audiences. The audience of 1937’s <em>Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs</em> is lead to see the powerful and independent female as a threat, with negative intentions, wicked jealousy and disregard. However, the audience of 2013’s <em>Frozen</em> is lead to see this powerful and independent female as a misunderstood hero, one who takes control of her own destiny and sets a good example. Female independence doesn’t have to come from jealous and evil villains, but can and should be born out of heroines. One may argue that with the female villains, Disney has been portraying strong and independent females all along. However, I would argue that there is an underlying negative message in portraying these things in antagonists. It would seem as though it is saying that females exhibiting these strengths and powers are doomed to be defeated, and receive an unhappy ending. While powerless and weaker female characters are the ones that receive, or “deserve” a happy ending. When self-sufficiency, sexuality and strength in female characters is only shown in the evil villains it provides an overall negative connotation to an audience of impressionable young kids. This makes protagonists displaying these traits all the more important.</p>\n<p>Music plays an important role, not only in the plot development, but also in offering a look into the messages of the films as well. Snow White sings the song “Someday My Prince Will Come.” The title itself lends to the passive dependence women were expected to take within romance and life that we have previously discussed. In the present day it is easy to see how this message doesn’t exactly work. Taken directly from the piece, “Wedding bells will ring, Someday when my dreams come true”. This presents the idea that a woman’s “dreams coming true” usually only involving “wedding bells ringing”. The way this idea is presented in the song is as if the only acceptable dream for women is being a wife dependent on males, which goes back to Snow White’s overall portrayal being based upon the strict standards and ideals society had for females.</p>\n<p>In Pocahontas’ “Just Around the Riverbend,” “Pocahontas’ dissatisfaction subverts the conventions of previous Disney songs” (Zarranz 58). This song presents her dissatisfaction with another character, Kocoum’s, marriage proposal. Pocahontas sings that she “ignores the sound of distant drumming” for a “handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls.” Along with this contrast, another interesting example of this subversion is in lyrics, from Snow White’s “Dreams Coming True” when “Wedding Bells Ring,” to Pocahontas singing “Should I Marry Kocoum? Is All My Dreaming at an End?” This direct contrast not only paints a woman’s dreams as something more than just finding a handsome, sturdy husband, but also showing that it could in fact signal the end of her dreams. So while Snow White exhibits the idealized and ultimately outdated and harmful concept that a woman’s wedding is the pinnacle of her life, Pocahontas exhibits the opposite. This song rather paints marriage as something she is dreading, rather than dreaming of. The song also paints Pocahontas as a very active part of her love life. While Snow White may sit at the riverbank waiting for high tide to bring in whatever prince she sings a duet with first, Pocahontas jumps right in, listens to her heart and wants to make her own decisions in her romantic life.</p>\n<p>Just like discussed previously, Elsa’s story and song “Let it Go” do not involve romantic love in the first place. While Snow White sings about a dream marriage proposal, and Pocahontas sings of a rejection of such concepts, Elsa’s main number is about her own liberation and power. This takes the ideas of female independence and freedom a step above Pocahontas and a leap above Snow White. Many lines of the song lend to the ideas of female independence, power and even underlying tones of sexual liberation. From the first verse’s “I couldn’t keep it in, heaven knows I tried” to the second verse’s “The fears that once controlled me, can’t get to me at all” addresses the restrictions Elsa, and many females, have experienced through both historic and modern society’s impossible standards for women. Elsa associates her power with fear and misunderstanding, but within this number we see not only acceptance, but celebration of being powerful. This also examines the danger of women living with such restrictions over their lives. Those restrictions only serve to create a sense of shame, fear and inequality from their male counterparts. “Let it Go” definitely ties us back to the ideas of sexual liberation through various undertones in the lyrics. The lyric that I believe sums up the entire idea of the song comes in the final chorus, “Let it go and I’ll rise like the break of dawn, let it go That perfect girl is gone, here I stand in the light of day.” “That Perfect Girl is Gone” not only excellently sums up the message of this song and film, but of the entire idea that I’m researching. The strive for perfection and unrealistic standards of beauty, femininity and the roles women are “supposed” to play in society are harmful and effectively “let go.” While, Elsa shows us the harms when we try to abide by these outdated expectations of Snow White, she also exhibits the liberation experienced when they are let go and is free and liberated similar to Pocahontas and takes it a step further.</p>\n<p>While the strives the Disney studios have made in terms of their portrayals of female independence within their films has proven to be quite progressive, it’s important to note that even the most recent characters and films aren’t without issues in terms of gender relations and equality. While, as discussed, it’s healthy for female sexuality to be more freely expressed, there is a line to be drawn between portraying females that are confident with their sexuality and females designed simply for sex appeal. This isn’t to say that certain misguided decisions behind the scenes totally discredit the positive aspects of these characters. An interesting project that I have come across called the “RealPrincess” which I found to be an excellent example of putting pressure on Disney studios to expand even further with their feminist evolution. This project entailed girls drawing their version of “Real Princesses” which included princess who were either non-attractive, plus-sized, disabled, gay, transgender, and other aspects not yet explored by Disney. We’ve seen unattractive males as protagonists but all of the females have been relatively pretty. I would like to think conversations like this would encourage a mainstream and popular studio like Disney to display these people’s different stories to their broad audience and would just hope that the audience would be receptive these different Princesses. However, if there is any criticism of this article, I would say that the strawman fallacy is utilized here by setting up these characters as easier to knock down. “One of the most nefarious aspects of the traditional Disney princess model is the stereotypical, hyper-feminine ideals their narratives promote” (Zellinger 3). The author seems to broadly generalize all of Disney’s female protagonists by the older stereotype of helpless damsels in distress in order to further make their argument. I feel Pocahontas, Mulan and Elsa are important points of progression, although their role as relatively attractive females remain. It is important to keep a certain amount of pressure on our media to keep striving to improve the portrayals of females, however, it is also important to still offer praise and encouragement for improvements that we do see.</p>\n<p>These three characters offer a glimpse into the overall evolution of female characters within Disney films. Putting them side by side we see how the portrayals of female liberation has gradually improved, results varying from a passive, naïve and virginal young girl to confident, strong willed and three-dimensional young women. It seems the further we venture into demonstrating complexity, independence and imperfections in females the closer we get to achieving the perfect female role model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Works-Cited\"><a href=\"#Works-Cited\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Works Cited\"></a>Works Cited</h3><p>England, D.

Dante is, after all, literally walking in Virgil’s wake for the entirety of the *Inferno*, and Virgil’s *Aeneid* makes all of Homer’s doubts about the figure explicit, dubbing him “that ringleader of atrocity” (6.709). Homer’s Odysseus is hardly a figure without ambiguity--this is a man who spends the entirety of the *Odyssey’s* twenty-second book murdering men who scarcely have a chance against him, aided as he is by a goddess and hardened by years of war. Leodes has his pleas for his life met with a“lopping blow/ so that his head went down to mouth in dust” (350-370). He thereafter proceeds to directing the murder of Penelope’s handmaidens:\n>“These dead must be disposed of first of all.\nDirect the women.  \nTables and chairs will be  \nScrubbed with sponges, rinsed and rinsed again.  \nTake them outside, these women,  \nBetween the roundhouse and palisade,   \nAnd hack them with your swordblades till you cut  \nThe life out of them, every thought of sweet  \nAphrodite under the rutting sutors,   \nWhere they lay down in secret.” (487-496)\n\nSo Odysseus seeks to humiliate these handmaidens before he has them butchered, sifting through the gore of their erstwhile lovers with the full knowledge of their own impending doom.  Thus, the reader of the *Odyssey* is confronted with a bizarre paradox: a man who slaughters suppliants who beg for their lives, and mercilessly orders the deaths of women who, given their servant status, are likely enslaved and therefore entirely unguarded against his whims;  yet this man has the tacit approval of heaven. It is the daughter of the highest god who has aided his journey thus far, and encourages and aids the slaughter (Athena in fact facilitates the test of the bow to “usher bloody slaughter in” at the beginning of Book Twenty-One). Even Virgil’s mutilated Deiphobus gives Ulysses a tacit connection to the heavens: his full nomenclature of Ulysses is, in fact, “that ringleader of atrocity...of the windking’s line (6.709-10). The “windking” being Zeus, the highest of gods (and “son of Laertes in the line of Zeus” is a frequent refrain throughout the Odyssey, another reinforcement of Odysseus’s connection with heaven). This is a strange juxtaposition to encounter, especially for a modern reader, one trained to associate the divine and the heavens with unambiguous moral purity. The presence of Ulysses in Dante’s hell therefore marks a significant change in thinking about such a character. Dante does not merely suggest retribution for the figure’s mythological crimes by condemning him to eternal punishment, but thereby actively severs any connection between Odysseus and the divine that gives him the license to carry out the deeds for which Dante sees him punished.\n\nDante suggests that the greatest suffering of those condemned to hell is the separation from God. Dante’s vision of hell seems to take its inception from the Book of Matthew, in which hell is the “outer darkness” in which there is “weeping and gnashing of teeth,” itself an expression of the misery of being excluded from God’s circle of light (8:12). Dante establishes this theme early in the *Inferno*. His fourth canto sees the Classical poets, although better off by far than the lower circle, condemned by having lived before Christ. Virgil tells Dante:\n>“Though they [the virtuous pagans] have merit,  \nThat is not enough, for they were unbaptized,  \nDenied the gateway to the faith you profess.  \nAnd if they lived before the Christians lived,   \nThey did not worship God aright.  \nAnd among these I am one.  \nFor such defects, and for no other fault,   \nWe are lost, and afflicted but in this,  \nThat without hope we live in longing.” (34-42)   \n\nThe “longing” in which these shades live is the longing for God. Their punishment is only to be excluded from such a presence. This fundamental absence of God’s presence is represented throughout by persistent assault on the senses, the presence of foul smells and a suggestion of cloying darkness. In Dante’s fifth canto, in which one finds the circle of the lustful, note is taken of the “malignant air” (86). His eighteenth canto doubles down on this motif: some of the damned are “snuffling with their snouts,” and this motion invokes the images of pigs, often associated with filth (104). “The banks...were coated with a mould/ offending eyes and nose” (104, 106-8). The flatterers and panderers dwell in excrement (113). What the absence of God suggests to Dante is filth and sickness, the inverse of the light and health with which he associates the divine.\n\nIt is the establishment of this theme of distance from God that makes the presence of Ulysses remarkable. After having seen Ulysses’ persistent association with the divine, even in Virgil, in which he is also explicitly condemned for his crimes against the Trojans, it is worth noting that Dante explicitly aligns God against Ulysses. Of Ulysses Virgil says: “Within this flame find torment/ Ulysses and Diomed. They are paired/ In God’s revenge as once they earned his wrath” (26.55-7). For Dante to completely divorce Ulysses from his associations with the divine is to represent a significant change in the way such a character is viewed. Ulysses has, in effect, gone from being a descendent of the highest god, favored and protected by the daughter goddess of the highest god, to being explicitly on the receiving end of the wrath of Dante’s God. The travails of Odysseus and his fellow Greeks are implied to be vengeance for the horrors committed at Troy, a city built by gods. But throughout his travails, Odysseus is never fully separated from the divine in a way that, to Dante, means punishment. On his journey, Odysseus also receives favor from divine figures like Circe and Calypso, even as he receives rancor from figures like Poseidon. Dante casts Ulysses thoroughly out from the graces of the divine, resulting in his eternal condemnation. Even Poseidon’s wrath was impermanent, as was Odysseus’s exile from home. The exile which Dante presents is of a more permanent nature. Since Dante’s hell is a place of exile from God and the divine, for Ulysses to be there represents a change in the way God is viewed.\n\nFor Odysseus to have offended Poseidon, as he does by blinding Polyphemus in Book Nine of the *Odyssey*, is to have alienated himself from one god. The persistent aid of Athena and other divine forces suggests that in a polytheistic religious system, alienation from one god will not result in entire alienation from divine forces and their graces. The naming of Ulysses as being in the line of the “windking” (Zeus) in the *Aeneid* maintains a sense of his being guarded and enclosed by his association with divine forces. This suggests that the scorn of Deiphobus’ shade can do little to touch such a figure, since he is still within “the line of Zeus.” But, of course, within Dante’s religious system, there is but one God rather than a host of them, and to alienate oneself from this God leaves one outside the circle of the divine entirely. The presence of Ulysses in the *Inferno* therefore suggests a drastic change in the view of the divine through the view of one mythological figure. A massive change in the conception of morality is suggested as well. Since, in the polytheistic Greek system one can carry out morally questionable or outright reprehensible behavior and still be likely to retain the favor of some divine forces, as indeed Odysseus does, then this indicates differing sets of rules of conduct that are highly context-dependent. Dante, on the other hand, reveals the change inherent in the Judeo-Christian system and its effect on the conception of morality: one God, and the one unifying set of moral rules and rules of conduct that having one divine force suggests. Ulysses is therefore unshielded by fragmented divine forces from retribution for his conduct in Dante’s view. Having alienated what Dante sees as the only God, Ulysses has effectually been alienated, cast out, from the divine itself. The guard of Athena can hardly be useful to Ulysses in the moral universe of Dante, who would undoubtedly have seen the goddess as part of the cadre of “false and lying gods” which Virgil repudiates (1.72).\n\nThe final fatal journey which Ulysses recounts to Virgil and Dante is itself an important expression of this separation from the divine. His presence in a lower circle of hell than the virtuous pagans is especially noteworthy, as this separation is itself only a further extension of Ulysses’ separation from the divine.  In Dante’s Twenty-Sixth Canto, Ulysses recalls his desire to exceed the boundaries of mortal exploration and knowledge:\n>“Not tenderness for a son, nor filial duty  \nToward my aged father, nor love I owed  \nPenelope that would have made her glad  \nCould overcome the fervor that was mine   \nTo gain experience of the world   \nAnd learn about man’s vices, and his worth…  \nI and my shipmates had grown old and slow  \nBy the time we reached the narrow strait  \nWhere Hercules marked off the limits,  \nWarning all men to go no farther.” (94-109)\n\nUlysses has been explicitly condemned to the circle of the fraudulent because of the Trojan Horse, but his final journey represents an implicit reason for punishment as well: Ulysses has pushed against the boundaries of mortality, seeking out knowledge reserved for the divine alone. Ulysses goes on to encourage his men to seek out the world where “no one lives,” a further implication of this realm’s prohibition against mortal knowledge (117). Here, Dante has placed Ulysses again beyond the ken of the divine, implicitly associating him with mortality, and further dissociating him from the privileges of divine knowledge. Ulysses admonishes the reluctance of his men: “Consider how your souls were sown/ you were not made to live like brutes or beasts/ but to pursue virtue and knowledge” (118-20). Here, Ulysses is implicitly encouraging the transgression of a boundary between the divine and the mortal. His pursuit of divine knowledge recalls the transgression of Adam and Eve, eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and being subsequently brutally punished for their attempt to access something which can only be the province of God. The dashing to pieces of Ulysses’ ship represents the final divorce of this figure from any divine connections (138). Dante thoroughly reinforces Ulysses’ mortality and exclusion from the realm of the divine not merely with his God-ordained punishment in hell, but with his death, resulting as it does from Ulysses’ attempt to grasp an understanding from which he is excluded by dint of being mortal.     \n\nThe presence of Ulysses in the hell built by Dante is both a commentary on the Classical tradition of such a figure as well as an indicator of the vast change in moral systems represented by the Judeo-Christian tradition within which Dante is working. While Virgil condemns Odysseus for his crimes against the Trojans, he nevertheless maintains a tacit connection between this figure and the divine. Dante does something entirely new by completely divorcing this figure from the divine, and in Dante’s view, therefore any connection to approval or heroism. The presence of Ulysses is a more subtle expression of Dante’s disapproval for the “false and lying gods” of the Greco-Roman world. Dante re-appropriates a figure which had formerly enjoyed some approval by the heavens, however ambiguously he was represented, and thoroughly out casts him from the circle of divine regard. Dante is, through this re-contextualization, representing the shift from the polytheistic system of ancient Greece to the Judeo-Christian tradition, in which one must follow a unifying set of rules in order to avert permanently alienating oneself from the singular divine force which governs Dante’s universe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Works Cited\nDante. *Inferno*.

The persistent aid of Athena and other divine forces suggests that in a polytheistic religious system, alienation from one god will not result in entire alienation from divine forces and their graces. The naming of Ulysses as being in the line of the “windking” (Zeus) in the *Aeneid* maintains a sense of his being guarded and enclosed by his association with divine forces. This suggests that the scorn of Deiphobus’ shade can do little to touch such a figure, since he is still within “the line of Zeus.” But, of course, within Dante’s religious system, there is but one God rather than a host of them, and to alienate oneself from this God leaves one outside the circle of the divine entirely. The presence of Ulysses in the *Inferno* therefore suggests a drastic change in the view of the divine through the view of one mythological figure. A massive change in the conception of morality is suggested as well. Since, in the polytheistic Greek system one can carry out morally questionable or outright reprehensible behavior and still be likely to retain the favor of some divine forces, as indeed Odysseus does, then this indicates differing sets of rules of conduct that are highly context-dependent. Dante, on the other hand, reveals the change inherent in the Judeo-Christian system and its effect on the conception of morality: one God, and the one unifying set of moral rules and rules of conduct that having one divine force suggests. Ulysses is therefore unshielded by fragmented divine forces from retribution for his conduct in Dante’s view. Having alienated what Dante sees as the only God, Ulysses has effectually been alienated, cast out, from the divine itself. The guard of Athena can hardly be useful to Ulysses in the moral universe of Dante, who would undoubtedly have seen the goddess as part of the cadre of “false and lying gods” which Virgil repudiates (1.72).\n\nThe final fatal journey which Ulysses recounts to Virgil and Dante is itself an important expression of this separation from the divine. His presence in a lower circle of hell than the virtuous pagans is especially noteworthy, as this separation is itself only a further extension of Ulysses’ separation from the divine.  In Dante’s Twenty-Sixth Canto, Ulysses recalls his desire to exceed the boundaries of mortal exploration and knowledge:\n>“Not tenderness for a son, nor filial duty  \nToward my aged father, nor love I owed  \nPenelope that would have made her glad  \nCould overcome the fervor that was mine   \nTo gain experience of the world   \nAnd learn about man’s vices, and his worth…  \nI and my shipmates had grown old and slow  \nBy the time we reached the narrow strait  \nWhere Hercules marked off the limits,  \nWarning all men to go no farther.” (94-109)\n\nUlysses has been explicitly condemned to the circle of the fraudulent because of the Trojan Horse, but his final journey represents an implicit reason for punishment as well: Ulysses has pushed against the boundaries of mortality, seeking out knowledge reserved for the divine alone. Ulysses goes on to encourage his men to seek out the world where “no one lives,” a further implication of this realm’s prohibition against mortal knowledge (117). Here, Dante has placed Ulysses again beyond the ken of the divine, implicitly associating him with mortality, and further dissociating him from the privileges of divine knowledge. Ulysses admonishes the reluctance of his men: “Consider how your souls were sown/ you were not made to live like brutes or beasts/ but to pursue virtue and knowledge” (118-20). Here, Ulysses is implicitly encouraging the transgression of a boundary between the divine and the mortal. His pursuit of divine knowledge recalls the transgression of Adam and Eve, eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and being subsequently brutally punished for their attempt to access something which can only be the province of God. The dashing to pieces of Ulysses’ ship represents the final divorce of this figure from any divine connections (138). Dante thoroughly reinforces Ulysses’ mortality and exclusion from the realm of the divine not merely with his God-ordained punishment in hell, but with his death, resulting as it does from Ulysses’ attempt to grasp an understanding from which he is excluded by dint of being mortal.     \n\nThe presence of Ulysses in the hell built by Dante is both a commentary on the Classical tradition of such a figure as well as an indicator of the vast change in moral systems represented by the Judeo-Christian tradition within which Dante is working. While Virgil condemns Odysseus for his crimes against the Trojans, he nevertheless maintains a tacit connection between this figure and the divine. Dante does something entirely new by completely divorcing this figure from the divine, and in Dante’s view, therefore any connection to approval or heroism. The presence of Ulysses is a more subtle expression of Dante’s disapproval for the “false and lying gods” of the Greco-Roman world. Dante re-appropriates a figure which had formerly enjoyed some approval by the heavens, however ambiguously he was represented, and thoroughly out casts him from the circle of divine regard. Dante is, through this re-contextualization, representing the shift from the polytheistic system of ancient Greece to the Judeo-Christian tradition, in which one must follow a unifying set of rules in order to avert permanently alienating oneself from the singular divine force which governs Dante’s universe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Works Cited\nDante. *Inferno*.

Dante is, after all, literally walking in Virgil’s wake for the entirety of the <em>Inferno</em>, and Virgil’s <em>Aeneid</em> makes all of Homer’s doubts about the figure explicit, dubbing him “that ringleader of atrocity” (6.709). Homer’s Odysseus is hardly a figure without ambiguity–this is a man who spends the entirety of the <em>Odyssey’s</em> twenty-second book murdering men who scarcely have a chance against him, aided as he is by a goddess and hardened by years of war. Leodes has his pleas for his life met with a“lopping blow/ so that his head went down to mouth in dust” (350-370). He thereafter proceeds to directing the murder of Penelope’s handmaidens:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“These dead must be disposed of first of all.<br>Direct the women.<br>Tables and chairs will be<br>Scrubbed with sponges, rinsed and rinsed again.<br>Take them outside, these women,<br>Between the roundhouse and palisade,<br>And hack them with your swordblades till you cut<br>The life out of them, every thought of sweet<br>Aphrodite under the rutting sutors,<br>Where they lay down in secret.” (487-496)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Odysseus seeks to humiliate these handmaidens before he has them butchered, sifting through the gore of their erstwhile lovers with the full knowledge of their own impending doom.  Thus, the reader of the <em>Odyssey</em> is confronted with a bizarre paradox: a man who slaughters suppliants who beg for their lives, and mercilessly orders the deaths of women who, given their servant status, are likely enslaved and therefore entirely unguarded against his whims;  yet this man has the tacit approval of heaven. It is the daughter of the highest god who has aided his journey thus far, and encourages and aids the slaughter (Athena in fact facilitates the test of the bow to “usher bloody slaughter in” at the beginning of Book Twenty-One). Even Virgil’s mutilated Deiphobus gives Ulysses a tacit connection to the heavens: his full nomenclature of Ulysses is, in fact, “that ringleader of atrocity…of the windking’s line (6.709-10). The “windking” being Zeus, the highest of gods (and “son of Laertes in the line of Zeus” is a frequent refrain throughout the Odyssey, another reinforcement of Odysseus’s connection with heaven). This is a strange juxtaposition to encounter, especially for a modern reader, one trained to associate the divine and the heavens with unambiguous moral purity. The presence of Ulysses in Dante’s hell therefore marks a significant change in thinking about such a character. Dante does not merely suggest retribution for the figure’s mythological crimes by condemning him to eternal punishment, but thereby actively severs any connection between Odysseus and the divine that gives him the license to carry out the deeds for which Dante sees him punished.</p>\n<p>Dante suggests that the greatest suffering of those condemned to hell is the separation from God. Dante’s vision of hell seems to take its inception from the Book of Matthew, in which hell is the “outer darkness” in which there is “weeping and gnashing of teeth,” itself an expression of the misery of being excluded from God’s circle of light (8:12). Dante establishes this theme early in the <em>Inferno</em>. His fourth canto sees the Classical poets, although better off by far than the lower circle, condemned by having lived before Christ. Virgil tells Dante:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Though they [the virtuous pagans] have merit,<br>That is not enough, for they were unbaptized,<br>Denied the gateway to the faith you profess.<br>And if they lived before the Christians lived,<br>They did not worship God aright.<br>And among these I am one.<br>For such defects, and for no other fault,<br>We are lost, and afflicted but in this,<br>That without hope we live in longing.” (34-42)   </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The “longing” in which these shades live is the longing for God. Their punishment is only to be excluded from such a presence. This fundamental absence of God’s presence is represented throughout by persistent assault on the senses, the presence of foul smells and a suggestion of cloying darkness. In Dante’s fifth canto, in which one finds the circle of the lustful, note is taken of the “malignant air” (86). His eighteenth canto doubles down on this motif: some of the damned are “snuffling with their snouts,” and this motion invokes the images of pigs, often associated with filth (104). “The banks…were coated with a mould/ offending eyes and nose” (104, 106-8). The flatterers and panderers dwell in excrement (113). What the absence of God suggests to Dante is filth and sickness, the inverse of the light and health with which he associates the divine.</p>\n<p>It is the establishment of this theme of distance from God that makes the presence of Ulysses remarkable. After having seen Ulysses’ persistent association with the divine, even in Virgil, in which he is also explicitly condemned for his crimes against the Trojans, it is worth noting that Dante explicitly aligns God against Ulysses. Of Ulysses Virgil says: “Within this flame find torment/ Ulysses and Diomed. They are paired/ In God’s revenge as once they earned his wrath” (26.55-7). For Dante to completely divorce Ulysses from his associations with the divine is to represent a significant change in the way such a character is viewed. Ulysses has, in effect, gone from being a descendent of the highest god, favored and protected by the daughter goddess of the highest god, to being explicitly on the receiving end of the wrath of Dante’s God. The travails of Odysseus and his fellow Greeks are implied to be vengeance for the horrors committed at Troy, a city built by gods. But throughout his travails, Odysseus is never fully separated from the divine in a way that, to Dante, means punishment. On his journey, Odysseus also receives favor from divine figures like Circe and Calypso, even as he receives rancor from figures like Poseidon. Dante casts Ulysses thoroughly out from the graces of the divine, resulting in his eternal condemnation. Even Poseidon’s wrath was impermanent, as was Odysseus’s exile from home. The exile which Dante presents is of a more permanent nature.
