Content of My Skin","author":"Emilyann Thompson","headerimage":"img/header-thecontentofmyskin.jpg","accenttext":"I believe that my black is beautiful and I will take it day by day until I can truly live what I believe.","layout":"article","_content":"I always thought my skin was too dark. Well actually not always. I did not think I was  too dark until about middle school when a little boy asked if my mom had left me in the oven for too long. It’s okay, you can laugh. For a while I did too. You see, everything is funny when everyone is laughing, but things seemingly became a lot less funny when I was alone.  I was left with just me, and my reflection.\n\n Freshman year was when the jokes that I used to laugh along with started to sting. My skin was no longer a class joke or lunch table chuckle but it was the burden I carried. I was told told I was not datable because I was too dark and that their “mom wouldn't mind but their dad would.” Ruefully, it was not because I was Black but because I was dark. Apparently having lighter skin always correlated with being mixed  or having Irish in your blood. I don't know. All I knew was that my DNA had failed me and my skin definitely couldn't hide the fact that I was surely, undoubtedly, one hundred percent Black.\n\n “You MUST be mixed with something, there is no way you could be just Black,” was what my friend was told one day at lunch, simply because she happened to be of a lighter complexion. It was as if to be African American you had to have skin like the night, and a nose as broad as the sea; as if having those characteristics were not special or wrong.\n\n Freshman year I spent a lot of time in the mirror, day dreaming of what it would be like to have long curly hair and be a lighter Black girl. The “right” kind of Black girl. Although I was a freshman in highschool, I still could not understand the concept of making judgements based off someone’s skin. “Why don't people just get to know people?” I asked my mom.\n\n“I do not know ” she always seemed to respond. No one ever seemed to know the answers to the questions I had, and it seemed like the more my questions went unanswered, the angrier I got. Broken mirrors were replaced with new ones all the way up through my senior year of highschool.\n\nThe broadcasts of jokes about my skin had stopped and I had stopped daydreaming in mirrors.The thing about judging someone is that physical attributes are only one way to make assumptions. I can think back to that day I was in the hallway at my locker, talking to some of my friends from the period before.\n\nI preceded to cackle from a joke that was made following a funny meme my friend had showed me. My voice echoed down the halls and happened to summon a guy I knew, who was mutual friends of the people I was standing with. He walked over and smirked, staring at me for a few minutes and listened to me talk before he said what he said.\n\n*“Yo you sound White as hell”*\n*“Huh?”*  \nConfused, all I could do was let out a stiff laugh to clear the air of awkwardness.\n\nBut to my surprise, as soon as he said that, all my friends joined in agreement. They began to declare their reasons for why the way I laughed, talked, and carried myself was as of another race other than my own. The years of high school I spent attempting to embrace my “Black culture” seemed to fade away in that distinct moment. I traded my Converses in for Timbs back in my sophomore year, embracing the burden of my skin that everyone around me seemed to think I had.\n\n\n I had cracked. Hiding my exterior self seemed to awaken me more within. Now I'm being told that, although I look Black, I don’t sound it. I went from being too black to not being Black enough. It felt like i was climbing this huge mountain and when I finally reached the pinnacle,  just when I just started to feel the breeze and see the beauty of all that was around me, I would reach up to grab that last bit of rock and would stretch, and stretch, but still couldn't reach it.\n Fast forward to college.\n\nYou see, i wish I could give you a Disney ending, or that i've found, the potion, or antidote for my disease. That the solution to my problem was in a book or online. I wish I could tell you that one day all of my insecurities vanished and that I was made whole, but this is a mountain that I am still climbing.\n\nI now understand that the power of who I am lies not within others, but within who I say I am. My experiences can now encourage or relate to someone else, and to me,  that's the most significant solution there is.

What follows next is an embarrassing dialogue between Chris and Rose's parents, Dean and Missy.

The purpose of Chris' imprisonment soon becomes apparent; his body is to be auctioned off to a cabal of wealthy bidders.

This is the very essence of \"living vicariously\" through someone, the very concept that I mentioned in my opening paragraph.

Instead, the very humanity was stripped from these unfortunate Black folks who simply were guilty of having \"desirable traits.\"  \n\nNeedless to say, the release of *Get Out* caused quite a stir in America.  The film was highly praised, but also was critiqued as unrealistic and far-fetched.   However, I would argue that Jordan Peele is quite correct in his description of the Sunken Place.  The history of race relations in the United States has been one of intolerance and unmitigated strife.  Before I begin the main premise of this essay, I would like to state to the reader that the term \"race\" is simply a construct.  There is only one race, and 99.99% of all humans have the same ancestral mother.  The African American sociologist W.E. Du Bois believed that race was erroneously being used to describe social and cultural diversity (Gannon, 2016). Modern science agrees that cultural and ethnic diversities truly define human beings, and features, such as skin tone, are simply phenotypes. The aspect of skin color has been one of the most divisive topics in the United States.  When African slaves were brought to this country, it was determined by the Dutch, Americans, and the British that Blacks were simply inferior because of differing phenotypes.  To the European and American mind, Blacks were simply brutish beasts that made excellent maids, laborers, breeders, and in the case of female slaves, sexual partners.  \n\n##  Slave Auction Flyer from 1823\n![slave auction flyer](img/getout1.jpg)\n\tThere has been a Civil War fought over the issue of slavery, despite the increase of revisionist history pertaining to this subject. South Carolina did fire on Fort Sumter and signed the Declaration of Causes, along with Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia.  After the Emancipation Proclamation, very little changed for freed Blacks in the South, and many migrated up to the Northern states.  Education, family, and especially religion were the glue that held black folk together.  However, American society was not ready to embrace the Negro as an equal.  Blacks still couldn't vote until the Civil Rights Act of 1965, and were viewed as 3/5ths of a person.  The Jim Crow laws that were put in place to systematically oppress Blacks, only fueled the desire for Blacks to strive for freedom from oppression.\n\nIn the arena of sports, Blacks were grudgingly considered superior in some aspects.  Jack Johnson stunned the boxing world by winning the Heavyweight Championship in 1908 by beating Tommy Burns from Canada.  Johnson's dominance of that weight class caused resentment among White boxing fans, who began to look for a \"great White hope\" to deliver the belt back to White hands (ESPN).  Jesse Owens' performance at the 1936 Munich stunned Aryan Germany and the world, but he couldn't find viable work after the Olympics.  As a black athlete, you gained fame and wealth (if you were fortunate), but you never gained respect or parity in the eyes of White America. As Blacks became more educated and excelled in the fields of education, literature, and music, many Whites in America viewed this progress with trepidation.  What if Blacks began to demand the same rights that Whites are afforded?  Would these Blacks want to move into our theaters, attend our schools, and date our sons and daughters?    We see the rise of the Civil Rights Movement with leaders such as King, Malcolm X, and Fred Hampton, each heading up different organizations with the purpose of empowering Blacks.  Despite the race riots of the 60s, despite the institutionalized racism that exists at every level, despite the CIA seeding black neighborhoods with drugs to destroy black families (by incarcerating Black males), African-Americans have continued to survive (Grim, 2017).  \n\nThe Sunken Place is a burden that most Black Americans experience in some form every day.  I believe that Lyndon B. Johnson summed it up best: \"If you can convince the lowest White man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you (Moyer)\".    From a young age, we as Blacks, especially males,  have been taught by our families to watch our actions and words around white people. We as Blacks refer to this as \"the talk.\"  It is not because we lack socialization skills or intelligence, this is done not to offend White people.  The subject of injustice and grievance against minorities goes against the tale (really, myth) of American exceptionalism that is trotted out so conveniently.  White privilege is fragile, and such matters such as reform, introspection, and listening to people of color are low on the list of priorities.  Most minorities are hard working Americans who are just trying to achieve success in life, nothing more.   We don't want your jobs, your homes, anything else that you possess, White America.  We just want to succeed on our own merits, and to be left alone.  We have given America greats in music (jazz, blues, modern gospel, rock), art and literature, medicine, sports, and the first minority President (whose family is superior in every metric compared to the current occupants), and the greatest power couple on the planet in the persons of Beyonce and Jay-Z.  \n\nHowever, it is exhausting to always be on guard when interacting with members of society, to have a palpable fear of dehumanization, marginalization, and often, subtle microaggressions.  \n *Get Out* was not just a movie about open racism or White supremacy, but how even seemingly liberal-minded, well- intentioned people can have just as much implicit bias as an openly bigoted person.\n\nTo illustrate an example of the  sunken place that minorities have to deal with constantly,  some White fans shared their view of the film with Allison Williams, who played the evil antagonist Rose Armitage. Not all viewers could understand how a clean cut, all-American young woman such as Rose could be such an evil character (hmm, probably chaotic evil, but that's for another day).  Allison Williams was being interviewed on Late Night with Seth, and she shared her frustration about how some fans would say the following:\n\n“They’d say ‘she was hypnotized, right?’ And I’m like, no! She’s *just* evil!*\n! How hard is that to accept? She’s bad! We gave you *so many ways*\n to know that she’s bad! She has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her! The *minute she can* she hangs them back up on the wall behind her. That’s so crazy! And they’re still like, ‘but maybe she’s also a victim?’ And I’m like, NO! No! And I will say, that is one hundred percent white people who say that to me,\" (Late Night Seth).\n\nThe above passage indicates that despite the very real concepts of institutional racism, discrimination, and murder that has defined America's social fabric that Jordan Peele based this entire film on, many whites simply erased these concerns by viewing the movie through the lens of White privilege. Regardless, Jordan Peele created a film that has gotten not just film viewers, but the country talking about race, power dynamics, and inequality.  However, I will leave the reader with one question.  In this politically charged climate, is *Get Out*\n about the subjugation of Black people, or is it a film commentating on the marginalization of all people who are disenfranchised?\n\n\n\n## Works Cited\nhttp://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00014275.html\n\nGannon, M.

What follows next is an embarrassing dialogue between Chris and Rose’s parents, Dean and Missy. Dean and Missy assure Chris that they are fine with their daughter dating a Black man, but Chris becomes suspicious of their strained behavior.  He happens to notice that the black servants in the Armitage home are puppet-like, as if almost controlled. The turning point of the film occurs when Chris is sitting down with Missy, who is a trained psychologist.  Missy is upset that Chris is a smoker, and feels that his smoking habit endangers the health of her daughter.

The purpose of Chris’ imprisonment soon becomes apparent; his body is to be auctioned off to a cabal of wealthy bidders.

The history of race relations in the United States has been one of intolerance and unmitigated strife.  Before I begin the main premise of this essay, I would like to state to the reader that the term “race” is simply a construct.  There is only one race, and 99.99% of all humans have the same ancestral mother.  The African American sociologist W.E. Du Bois believed that race was erroneously being used to describe social and cultural diversity (Gannon, 2016). Modern science agrees that cultural and ethnic diversities truly define human beings, and features, such as skin tone, are simply phenotypes. The aspect of skin color has been one of the most divisive topics in the United States.  When African slaves were brought to this country, it was determined by the Dutch, Americans, and the British that Blacks were simply inferior because of differing phenotypes.  To the European and American mind, Blacks were simply brutish beasts that made excellent maids, laborers, breeders, and in the case of female slaves, sexual partners.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"Slave-Auction-Flyer-from-1823\"><a href=\"#Slave-Auction-Flyer-from-1823\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Slave Auction Flyer from 1823\"></a>Slave Auction Flyer from 1823</h2><p><img src=\"img/getout1.jpg\" alt=\"slave auction flyer\"><br>    There has been a Civil War fought over the issue of slavery, despite the increase of revisionist history pertaining to this subject. South Carolina did fire on Fort Sumter and signed the Declaration of Causes, along with Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia.  After the Emancipation Proclamation, very little changed for freed Blacks in the South, and many migrated up to the Northern states.  Education, family, and especially religion were the glue that held black folk together.  However, American society was not ready to embrace the Negro as an equal.

No one would believe her, anyway.","layout":"article","_content":"The townhouse wasn’t always this cluttered; there was once a time where the grass outside was cut properly, and where the windows didn’t let a cold draft in during the winter; where the thoughts in her mind of getting her next high didn’t overcome the fear of not feeding her two girls. Her body lay numbly on the couch, and she glanced at her worn-in piano across the living room and remembered how art once filled her life. Now, all that’s there is cracked family photos, and leaving her daughters alone at 3 AM to shuffle through the streets, in search for a “friend.” Interesting how that works, she thought; how thirty years ago, she would never let her home reek of cigarette smoke, and the painting on the walls chip off, or milk rot in the fridge for weeks on end.\n\n1981, December: who knows the actual day, she didn’t. Looking on the desk under her, she read the laminated file: “Lynne Molando, 18, 5’6, 125 lbs. black hair, brown eyes,” and the picture, her own eyes staring back at her, a sense of emptiness crossing her lips as the camera refused to flash. A husky man approached her from afar, and she felt herself reflexively sink smaller into her plastic chair.\n\n“Lynne, right?” the husky man said. His voice was a lot lighter then she had assumed, and he continued to look at her as his badge glared into her primary vision.\n\n“Y-yes,” she whispered. God, how weak she sounded. She tried to encourage herself to grow up, to sound more secure, confident, brave. All the things she was far from. “Yes,” she said more clearly.\n\n“I’m Officer Davison. Would you like to call anyone?” His accent wasn’t as thick as most of the southerners around. Maybe he wasn’t from around here. Lynne finally let her eyes leave his badge and meet his eyes, a radiant blue, and she was immediately crippled with fear, her recently repressed memories flooding back in. For a second, she contemplated reaching out to her parents, or maybe her brother even. But what would the point of that be? She knew they wouldn’t believe her regardless. She wanted to run. To rip these cold, metal handcuffs off, to find her beloved hypothetical Harley, and to toss a leather jacket on and never look back. Maybe she’d go to California, or back up north. It was stupid of her to have stayed home.\n\nIt was her first time here. The walls had seemingly been closing in on her for hours. She thought of how her brother was probably curled up at home with his latest medical novel. She chuckled to herself at the irony of their differences. Damn nerd. They were adopted, after all. She let her thoughts start to spiral, thinking about the course of events that led her to sit in the county police station, surrounded by pathetic druggies and people too incompetent to even understand the difference between Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. She was sore all over, from the running, from the falling, the jumping, the—she didn’t want to think about that, to follow what just occurred only a couple hours prior.\n\nIt was dusk, the sun finally setting earlier in the night. The Arkansas air was chilled, but she didn’t mind. The stars were too glorious to ignore, and as she walked back from her painting class, she felt security in the idea that as soon as she stepped foot in her oversized, empty home, she would disappear into her room and lock the door and let herself draw even more. Or maybe this time, she’d finally start strumming on the guitar her best friend Kyle let her borrow. Her parents would be asleep, so she wouldn’t have to worry about her father coming in and lecturing her about the importance of a solid education. She continued to walk and follow the sidewalk, the surface scraping the soles of her worn-in shoes, her hand gripping her folder containing her latest painting, legs sore from standing all day at a drug store unknown to most of the town.\n\nShe was a few blocks away. The roads were flat, and she didn’t complain too bad about walking. The longer it took her to get home, the better. In this case though, perhaps she should’ve sped up. Voices lingered in the distance behind her, male it sounded like. She recognized them snicker to one another, whispering vulgarities; nothing she hadn’t heard before. Her brother usually told those type of guys off. He wasn’t much of a fighter, but he was a person to defend her, at least. Her brother wasn’t here now. Nor was anyone else, by the looks of it. The streetlights here dimmed, and she was approaching the gap in the two adjoining neighborhoods that was accompanied by woods to the left.\n\n“Hey, sweetheart, wait up!” one of the guys called from behind her. The other laughed obnoxiously, allowing him to snort. Lynne did everything in her power to walk as fast as possible, without letting herself show that she was clearly concerned. But as she sped up, so did they. The hour was late, and she was already past curfew. Maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing if she gave into a slight jog... their footsteps echoed hers, almost in unison. “Where you goin’ hot stuff?” She was really starting to despise southern accents. She ran, like she had seen so many other girls do in movie scenes, so very similar to this. Those scenes usually didn’t end too well.\n\nShe cut through the woods. Big shocker, she thought to herself. Didn’t see that one coming. The woods had a wired gate stating “NO TRESPASSING” in bolded letters. She ignored them, as she had done in the past. She knew this area fairly well since she came here to draw, and she was certain she’d lose the horny assholes following behind her. Her jet-black hair blew violently, tangling behind her, sweat starting to pour down her olive-toned skin. Strands of fabric from her red sweater were starting to escape the tight knitting, but she kept pounding her feet against the dirt until she approached the abandoned, wood house that was once owned by what was rumored to be a participant in the Underground Railroad. She never believed that bullshit, but maybe just this once she would. She was comforted by the idea that this house could give her protection, too.\n\n“This bitch can run!” hollered one of her pursuers. They weren’t that far behind after all. Panicked, Lynne fled inside of the house, confident that the walls would perhaps deter them off. They didn’t. One stormed into the entrance, and her first thought was to dodge towards the back door. Yet, they were already ahead of her. Her other pursuer stormed in from the back, and in the light of the moon, she only got a faint look at them. Tall, slightly built, young. She put on her big girl pants. You got this. “Look, you’re gonna want to leave me be. My father is a highly important man and I would advise you —” her taunts were cut off by, again, that obnoxious laughter. “Woah man, look what we got here, a northerner? That’s even hotter.”\n\nLynne tensed up, realizing that her grand escape wouldn’t be so simple. She could smell the stench of weed and booze from a mile away. They were gone, unreachable in their already made-up minds. Time for Plan B. She started to step away, then quickly bolted around the first guy, only for him to spin around and grab her and pull her close against his chest. “Not so fast, sweetheart. We ain’t done wit you yet.”\n\nThey both laughed again (damn, how hideous their laughs were), as they tossed her onto the hard, wooden floor. There was nothing to do, no way out. She attempted to get up and regain her balance, only to be sat on by one of the two. He held her arms against the ground with one hand, while his other hand tussled with his belt.\n\n“Man, I’m gonna need ya’ help here. We’ll take turns alright?” The two chuckled and agreed as the other male crouched down over her head and held down her arms.\n\nShe froze. She thought and thought, there had to be something. She started screaming.\n\nShe screamed as loud as she ever did. Louder, in fact, than the one night when her father came home from work, when he told her how disappointed he was in her for not being like her brother. Louder than when he said that she was no longer his daughter. Louder than when she came home to see her mother bottles of wine deep after discovering his affair.\n\nShe screamed and kicked, but it was no use. Her legs were like dead tree trunks; trapped under the heavy weight of her attacker. So, she did the only two things she thought of. She tensed her muscles as tight as she could, and she prayed. She hadn’t prayed in some time. The past months had consisted of her being on a spiritual quest of some sort, but she prayed now, on a beat with the penetration of this person forcing himself in and out of her.\n\nTime lost its consistency. They switched up about halfway through. She tried to fight again. She stopped. She let her body break and fall within itself, as tears dripped numbly down her cheek. They stopped. Stood up. She heard an owl’s voice through the trees. She felt water rushing into her ears. Blood leaked onto her thigh. Her sweater was ripped. Laughter, again. Something was tossed on the ground. Weed? “Your payment,” one joked. “Catch ya later, baby.” They hustled their belts back on. They ran, and the wooden door slammed shut.\n\nShe had never been motionless before, never speechless. She slowly rose and slid her jeans back up her waist as if she had just taken a simple pee. Nothing else happened. Nothing. She picked up the weed and felt the weight of the drug in her palm. It was her first time touching any kind of substance, and the simple thought of inhaling it brought a pleasant glow into her mind. She needed that glow, even though nothing happened. Nothing.\n\nLynne left the house and worked her way towards the main road. She was sore, but not just her legs this time. Everywhere. There. But nothing happened. Nothing. She was approaching the wired fence with the sign when a bright set of headlights flashed onto her. She saw a badge, heard the car door slam, watched as a man in uniform made his way towards her, handcuffs clinking against his—belt—\n\n“Now, what do you think you’re doin’, missy?”\n\n“Nothing,” she gasped, realizing how her voice was nearly nonexistent. “Nothing happened.” She didn’t say anything. No one would believe her, anyway. She looked exactly like what her parents thought she was: a delinquent. Lynne sat in the station until her best friend found his way to bail her out. She told him she’d pay him back. He said that she didn’t have to.\nShe liked that idea; she wanted to start investing her money elsewhere.\n\nThe townhouse wasn’t always this cluttered, but she now lets the grass grow too long to walk through, she tapes the windows to avoid the cold air coming through and lets her older daughter go to bed without dinner. Life wasn’t meant to be easy. The girls were still at school, so she collapses once again on the couch as she ties a belt around her frail bicep, injecting a needle straight into her vein. Maybe one of these days, it will finally become enough.\n","source":"lynnmolando.md","raw":"---\ntitle: The Tale of Lynne Molando\nauthor: Eliana Puschett\nheaderimage: img/header-thetaleoflynnemolando.jpg\naccenttext: “Nothing,” she gasped, realizing how her voice was nearly nonexistent. “Nothing happened.” She didn’t say anything.

Her body lay numbly on the couch, and she glanced at her worn-in piano across the living room and remembered how art once filled her life. Now, all that’s there is cracked family photos, and leaving her daughters alone at 3 AM to shuffle through the streets, in search for a “friend.” Interesting how that works, she thought; how thirty years ago, she would never let her home reek of cigarette smoke, and the painting on the walls chip off, or milk rot in the fridge for weeks on end.</p>\n<p>1981, December: who knows the actual day, she didn’t. Looking on the desk under her, she read the laminated file: “Lynne Molando, 18, 5’6, 125 lbs. black hair, brown eyes,” and the picture, her own eyes staring back at her, a sense of emptiness crossing her lips as the camera refused to flash. A husky man approached her from afar, and she felt herself reflexively sink smaller into her plastic chair.</p>\n<p>“Lynne, right?” the husky man said. His voice was a lot lighter then she had assumed, and he continued to look at her as his badge glared into her primary vision.</p>\n<p>“Y-yes,” she whispered. God, how weak she sounded. She tried to encourage herself to grow up, to sound more secure, confident, brave. All the things she was far from. “Yes,” she said more clearly.</p>\n<p>“I’m Officer Davison. Would you like to call anyone?” His accent wasn’t as thick as most of the southerners around. Maybe he wasn’t from around here. Lynne finally let her eyes leave his badge and meet his eyes, a radiant blue, and she was immediately crippled with fear, her recently repressed memories flooding back in. For a second, she contemplated reaching out to her parents, or maybe her brother even. But what would the point of that be? She knew they wouldn’t believe her regardless. She wanted to run. To rip these cold, metal handcuffs off, to find her beloved hypothetical Harley, and to toss a leather jacket on and never look back. Maybe she’d go to California, or back up north. It was stupid of her to have stayed home.</p>\n<p>It was her first time here. The walls had seemingly been closing in on her for hours. She thought of how her brother was probably curled up at home with his latest medical novel. She chuckled to herself at the irony of their differences. Damn nerd. They were adopted, after all. She let her thoughts start to spiral, thinking about the course of events that led her to sit in the county police station, surrounded by pathetic druggies and people too incompetent to even understand the difference between Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. She was sore all over, from the running, from the falling, the jumping, the—she didn’t want to think about that, to follow what just occurred only a couple hours prior.</p>\n<p>It was dusk, the sun finally setting earlier in the night. The Arkansas air was chilled, but she didn’t mind. The stars were too glorious to ignore, and as she walked back from her painting class, she felt security in the idea that as soon as she stepped foot in her oversized, empty home, she would disappear into her room and lock the door and let herself draw even more. Or maybe this time, she’d finally start strumming on the guitar her best friend Kyle let her borrow. Her parents would be asleep, so she wouldn’t have to worry about her father coming in and lecturing her about the importance of a solid education. She continued to walk and follow the sidewalk, the surface scraping the soles of her worn-in shoes, her hand gripping her folder containing her latest painting, legs sore from standing all day at a drug store unknown to most of the town.</p>\n<p>She was a few blocks away. The roads were flat, and she didn’t complain too bad about walking. The longer it took her to get home, the better. In this case though, perhaps she should’ve sped up. Voices lingered in the distance behind her, male it sounded like. She recognized them snicker to one another, whispering vulgarities; nothing she hadn’t heard before. Her brother usually told those type of guys off. He wasn’t much of a fighter, but he was a person to defend her, at least. Her brother wasn’t here now. Nor was anyone else, by the looks of it. The streetlights here dimmed, and she was approaching the gap in the two adjoining neighborhoods that was accompanied by woods to the left.</p>\n<p>“Hey, sweetheart, wait up!” one of the guys called from behind her. The other laughed obnoxiously, allowing him to snort. Lynne did everything in her power to walk as fast as possible, without letting herself show that she was clearly concerned. But as she sped up, so did they. The hour was late, and she was already past curfew. Maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing if she gave into a slight jog… their footsteps echoed hers, almost in unison. “Where you goin’ hot stuff?” She was really starting to despise southern accents. She ran, like she had seen so many other girls do in movie scenes, so very similar to this. Those scenes usually didn’t end too well.</p>\n<p>She cut through the woods. Big shocker, she thought to herself. Didn’t see that one coming. The woods had a wired gate stating “NO TRESPASSING” in bolded letters. She ignored them, as she had done in the past. She knew this area fairly well since she came here to draw, and she was certain she’d lose the horny assholes following behind her. Her jet-black hair blew violently, tangling behind her, sweat starting to pour down her olive-toned skin. Strands of fabric from her red sweater were starting to escape the tight knitting, but she kept pounding her feet against the dirt until she approached the abandoned, wood house that was once owned by what was rumored to be a participant in the Underground Railroad. She never believed that bullshit, but maybe just this once she would. She was comforted by the idea that this house could give her protection, too.</p>\n<p>“This bitch can run!” hollered one of her pursuers. They weren’t that far behind after all. Panicked, Lynne fled inside of the house, confident that the walls would perhaps deter them off. They didn’t. One stormed into the entrance, and her first thought was to dodge towards the back door. Yet, they were already ahead of her. Her other pursuer stormed in from the back, and in the light of the moon, she only got a faint look at them. Tall, slightly built, young. She put on her big girl pants. You got this. “Look, you’re gonna want to leave me be. My father is a highly important man and I would advise you —” her taunts were cut off by, again, that obnoxious laughter. “Woah man, look what we got here, a northerner? That’s even hotter.”</p>\n<p>Lynne tensed up, realizing that her grand escape wouldn’t be so simple. She could smell the stench of weed and booze from a mile away. They were gone, unreachable in their already made-up minds. Time for Plan B. She started to step away, then quickly bolted around the first guy, only for him to spin around and grab her and pull her close against his chest. “Not so fast, sweetheart. We ain’t done wit you yet.”</p>\n<p>They both laughed again (damn, how hideous their laughs were), as they tossed her onto the hard, wooden floor. There was nothing to do, no way out. She attempted to get up and regain her balance, only to be sat on by one of the two. He held her arms against the ground with one hand, while his other hand tussled with his belt.</p>\n<p>“Man, I’m gonna need ya’ help here. We’ll take turns alright?” The two chuckled and agreed as the other male crouched down over her head and held down her arms.</p>\n<p>She froze. She thought and thought, there had to be something. She started screaming.</p>\n<p>She screamed as loud as she ever did. Louder, in fact, than the one night when her father came home from work, when he told her how disappointed he was in her for not being like her brother. Louder than when he said that she was no longer his daughter. Louder than when she came home to see her mother bottles of wine deep after discovering his affair.</p>\n<p>She screamed and kicked, but it was no use. Her legs were like dead tree trunks; trapped under the heavy weight of her attacker. So, she did the only two things she thought of. She tensed her muscles as tight as she could, and she prayed. She hadn’t prayed in some time.

Well that’s the point, isn’t it?  What would I want with slugs when I can have an equal, like you?”","layout":"article","_content":"Some little way off of the main road stood what must once have been a pleasant home. It was modest enough in size, but had the advantage of land and privacy. It stood two stories tall in a sizable garden, shielded from the road by a line of trees and straggling bushes. The lawn was overgrown, long grass competing with high weeds for the soil, while fallen leaves and twigs lay strewn about, unheeded. The house was at an awkward stage in its decay, being clearly abandoned, but not yet decrepit. The windows were dark and lifeless, some bereft of their screens and storm windows, others playing host to the thick, sticky strands of the local arachnid population. Blinds hung in crooked and gap-toothed disarray in the windows, and across the tattered sheer curtains of one downstairs room, a light flickered, betraying the presence of some intruder. Both front and back doors had been padlocked to prevent occurrences such as this, but one of the capacious rear windows stood open, the snib having been forced back. From this aperture there came a cornucopia of sounds, muffled by a closed door which separated it from the curtained front room. There was a drum beat, the melodic grinding of electric guitar, and a singing voice, but beneath these was the sound of whimpering, an occasional scream rising up to mingle and drown the music.\n\nA half-sobbing voice sounded through a lull in the song, “Please, just stop! I’m not-”\n\n“ ‘What I think.’ ” a voice interrupted, raised in mockery. “You’re just a paltry little nobody called Maggie. Do I honestly look that gullible to you?”\n\nInside, the stale air was cold, smelling of dust, wood, and rotting leaves. Riding on that smell, a strange, high note in the musky scent, was a  sharp, metallic tang. The source of this was a woman seated in an old-fashioned kitchen chair, intact despite its callus abandonment, and quite sturdy. Her arms were secured to those of the chair by chords at the wrists and the elbows. A rope passed under her arms, circling around her torso and the back of the seat, before being capably knotted. Her ankles were likewise tied to the legs of the chair, leaving her completely helpless. She could neither move, nor gain enough leverage to wriggle loose. Her mouth was free and hung open, sucking in air and issuing moans and little, choking sobs. The long blondish hair was frizzled and matted with the blood oozing from a cut and a rising lump under the hairline. It lay in clumps and wisps all about her face and head, getting stuck on the moistened trails about her eyes, nose, and lips.\n\nOver her stood another woman with a miner’s light strapped to her forehead, short red bristles of hair sticking up from where she’d pushed them out of the band. She wore military cargo pants and a black sleeveless T-shirt that showed the toned muscle of her shoulders. There were dark stains on her clothes, and speckles and smears of bright, rusty red on her arms. On her left hand there was a sparkle of metal which sent shimmers around the room whenever the light caught it. A thick metal cuff on her wrist sent five chains snaking down to a broad ring on the middle section of each finger. These rings in turn each sent two thinner, more delicate chains to the thimble-like objects fixed to the tip of each finger, and protruding in sharp, metallic points. The blood upon these was fresh and gleaming, forming droplets across the polished, golden lattice-work.\n\nA cylindrical wireless speaker sat on an old dresser in one corner of the room, pouring forth the music. Next to it was a soft leather tool satchel of the kind that rolls up. Now it was unfurled, and knife-handles of various sizes protruded. Beside this was a towel upon which the redhead carefully placed a medium-sized knife, it’s golden blade covered in gore. She moved away from the dresser and back to her prisoner, who gave a great, wracking sob.\n\n“Why are you doing this?” choked Maggie.\n\n“Because I want to,” said the woman, her voice clipped and cultured, and a smile in her tone. She knelt down and looked critically at one of her captive’s forearms, wiping away the blood which had flowed there from the long, glistening, raw strip on her upper arm. She sounded engaged, musing, and interested all at once, as if she were taking part in some philosophical debate. “It’s my belief that Man is really a very simple machine. There are certain things he has to do - eating, sleeping...”\n\nHaving chosen her spot, she began to trace one of her pointed fingertips slowly along the skin, leaving a trail of raised furrows from which blood began to bead. There was a hiss of indrawn breath which she ignored.\n\n“Everything else is optional. Most people don’t realize that, not really. In spite of all the winging and whining about circumstance, there’s no one who could stop them from doing exactly what they wanted, if they tried,” she paused her tracing, and gesticulated with a claw. “I have a theory that people like being miserable. It’s the only explanation for the snowflake generation.” She frowned, and stuck the claw back into Maggie’s skin. “I could never understand the pleasure of it, myself. Torment now! Fear. Pain. Those I like. Much like you, I suppose.”\n\nThe woman had completed the light tracing of a perfect rectangle in her victim’s flesh, and was looking, with a critical eye, at the bleeding lines as she spoke.\n\nMaggie shook her head. “No. I’m not like that. Please let me go!”\n\nA bubbling little giggle escaped the rust-smeared face as it leered close to the bound woman, its attention diverted from the wounds to the eyes of the victim. “Hahaha! Oh tut! You of all people should realize the futility of pleading! Nothing can take the fun out of sadism like a stoic mindset, so please! Beg. Barter. Struggle. Scream! Hurt me, if you can! It won’t do you an atom of good, but it will make things a lot more entertaining for me!”\n\nAt the last word she dug her index claw back into the inflamed lines of the rectangle and began to go over it again, her victim’s breath coming in gasps and half-screams as the golden point tore through dermis and membrane.\n\nWith the rectangle complete, and the blood now flowing rather than beading, the redhead stood up from her squat and walked leisurely over to the dresser, wiping her hands on a rag as she went. After a little consideration, she pulled a tiny golden blade from the roll. It was shaped almost like a cheese-knife. As she turned back toward her captive, the song changed. A tight, high-pitched marching snare pattern began, accompanied by a bass melody and acoustic guitar.\n\nThe satisfied smirk which had gently twisting the torturer’s mouth widened into a full-toothed grin, and she reached back to turn up the volume to its loudest extent. A deep female voice began to sing, a slight reverberation making her sound unreal as the music bombarded the room.\n\n*One pill makes you larger / And one pill makes you small*\n\nThe redhead half hummed, half sang the words as she squatted down and, her clawed left hand pressing firmly down to keep the arm still, began to delicately insert the knife under the hypodermis.\n\n*And if you go chasing rabbits / And you know you’re gonna fall*\n\nMaggie screamed and tried to thrash, but her voice was lost in the bass and the voice, which grew in volume as the song progressed. It was the work of a minute to slice the perfect rectangle of skin from the arm. It came away, caught between the woman’s thumb and the blade like an apple peel, and she flicked it into a tin pail with the matching strip from the upper arm. Next she cut a flap from Maggie’s jeans and began tracing the hollow outline of several curly, rune-like symbols into her thigh with a claw.\n\nShe had just taken up a long-handled, scalpel-like implement with a golden blade, and was about to slice the skin from within the outlines, when the music faded out prior to changing songs, and a faint thump echoed through the momentary silence. The woman instantly rose and turned off the speaker, leaving a bloody smudge on the silver button as she did.\nTurning back to the hapless captive, she pressed one delicate looking claw against her lips, and passed a blood-grained finger across her own mouth.\n\nTerrified eyes stared up at her. Maggie could not move her head because of the claw, around which blood was already seeping from punctured lips, but she rose her eyebrows in assent. Her tormentor was not paying attention, however. She had her head cocked to one side, and her eyes looked vacantly at the floor as she listened intently. Then, evidently having made up her mind, she strode over to the door and opened it, revealing the beams of two flashlights, and drawing a startled exclamatory from one of the men in the hallway.\n\nThere were two of them, roughly the same in height, though not in girth. Bulky vests and light blue shirts betrayed them at once as policemen, but the vest could not disguise a certain chubbiness in the younger one. It made him look about twelve. Their guns were not drawn, and their looks of shock turned quickly to bewilderment and horror as they took in the blood-caked figure in front of them.\n\nThe redhead’s mouth shifted a trifle, her lips compressing for a split second. Then, before they could say anything, she raised her hands in front of her and extended the claws toward them slowly.\n\n“This is strapped to my wrist. I’m going to take it off. There are knives in that room,” she tilted her head toward the door from which she’d emerged, “but I have none on me. I’m unarmed.”\n\nAs she spoke, she slowly undid the clasp of the metal cuff, and slid the contrivance from her fingers before placing it on the ground. The tight rings had left white bands on her fingers, which stood out, ghastly against the streaky patina of bright red and dark rust.\n\nBy now the policemen had drawn their weapons, realizing that this was not the junkie squatter situation that they had expected. As they edged toward her, still not really masters of the situation, there came a cry from the room. The policemen glanced sharply at the door, and the older one nodded to his junior to have a look.\n\n“There is a woman in there,” said the woman calmly, as the first man stepped toward her. “Whatever you do, don’t untie her. I’ll explain it all, very carefully, but on no account is she to be released.”\n\nEven as she spoke, the younger of the pair gave an exclamation, and she heard the mingled sounds of her victim’s frightened and grateful whimperings, and the boy’s comforting assurances that “everything was alright,” which it clearly wasn’t.\n“I don’t know why I bother,” said the redhead, shaking her head as she listened to the boy struggling with her efficient knots.\n\nShe had put her hands out, meekly, to be cuffed, but as the man snapped the first bracelet in place she grabbed the collar of his vest and struck him hard on the nose with her forehead. He crumpled at once, but as she was freeing her hand there was a ragged, high-pitched scream, and a startled yell from the boy. She snatched up the golden cuff and ran into the room, brandishing it like an exceptionally short flail. Her captive was loose from the chair, struggling with the boy on the ground. A swift blow to the back of the head elicited another scream, as a kick shifted her off of the boy. As the screaming form scrambled to her feet, the redhead snatched up a knife from the soft-leather roll. The two lunged at each other, one snarling as if her throat would burst, the other perfectly silent. The knife shot forward, a steel streak in the gloom, punching through muscles, veins, and cartilage until it was hilt-deep in Maggie’s neck.\n\nThe scream stopped, and a hollow, gurgling, liquid-like choking sound came from the gaping mouth as the body staggered back under the momentum of the thrust. The redhead didn’t stop to watch, but bent over the boy. His face was riven with deep scratches, and one ear was horribly torn, but his throat, much to her surprise, was intact. He was staring straight ahead with unfocused eyes, his breath shallow, his limbs beginning to tremble.\n\nShe slapped him hard across the face, restoring purpose to his gaze, and forced his head up to face her.\n\n“Hey, you’re alive,” she said, bruskly, her eyes flickering to his neck where a crucifix hung on a short golden chain. “That makes you lucky.”\n\nHe looked at her dumbly, and then his gaze slid behind her, the lids widening to expose the whites of his eyes. The hissing gurgle in the background grew more urgent, then ceased. The redhead turned to see the bleeding blond rising to its feet. The knife was grasped in its hand, and the wound at its throat was closing rapidly, leaving only a vivid red splatter on its collar. Its teeth were bared, and a manic grin suffused its face. More blood was trickling through its hair from the unhealed wounds that the makeshift flail had inflicted, but it didn’t seem to care. A malevolence, wholly human in its intensity, yet without the associated restraint, radiated from the creature in perfume-like clouds.\n\n“Hypocrite!” it hissed through newly repaired vocal chords.\n\n“Absolutely,” said the redhead.\n\n“You try to kill me, and you defend that slug, when you admit that we’re alike.”\n\n“Alike. Yes. Well that’s the point, isn’t it?  What would I want with slugs when I can have an equal, like you?” With those words, she drew a hand from her cargo pocket and threw a handful of sparkling dust with all her might, straight into the blonde's face. It inhaled on reflex and instantly choked, falling to its knees as it tried to suck air into gold-encrusted lungs.\n\nThe redhead snapped her fingers at the policeman. “You! Keep her still!” she barked as she returned to the dresser and picked up the scalpel.\n\nHe didn’t move.\n\n“Now!” she snapped, grasping the slobbering figure by the shoulders. “Before she coughs it up!”\n\nHe flinched and moved forward as she threw the monster onto its back.\n\n“Put your weight on that leg and keep it as still as you can.”\n\nHe obeyed dumbly, and sat on the calf of the leg on which the sigils were traced. He placed his hands on the knee joint and leaned forward, preventing the leg from bending.\n\n“Good,” said the redhead, as she sat herself on the monster’s stomach, crushing it to the floor.\n\nIt took about two minutes to carve out the flesh from the traced outlines, but it felt like more. The struggles grew stronger and stronger, and by the time the last squiggle was hollowed out, they could barely keep her pinned down.\n\n“Ok, let go!” yelled the redhead.\n\nThe boy was sent flying by a kick as soon as he shifted his weight, and the redhead was instantly flipped onto her back with a set of vice-like hands wrapped about her throat. The grip lasted only a split second before the monster screamed in pain and rage and jerked away, the scalpel embedded in its hand. It yanked it free and began raining down blows upon the redhead pinned beneath it. The ragged, gasping breath became more and more labored, and after half a dozen punches, it fell forward, sprawling across the other woman.\n\n“My round, I think,” said the redhead, softly.\n\nIt was a few minutes before she collected her scattered wits and pushed the corpse from her. When at last she staggered to her feet, she found the boy unconscious against the wall. Within twenty minutes both he and his older colleague were locked in the mossy remains of the bathroom, safely out of the way. By the time they had both come around and broken out of their temporary prison, the only signs remaining of their adventure were a headache, several deep scratches,  some disturbances in the dust, and the smell of bleach in the front room.\n","source":"skin.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Skin\nauthor: Victoria Wroblewski\nheaderimage: img/header-skin.jpg\naccenttext: “Alike.

Next to it was a soft leather tool satchel of the kind that rolls up. Now it was unfurled, and knife-handles of various sizes protruded. Beside this was a towel upon which the redhead carefully placed a medium-sized knife, it’s golden blade covered in gore. She moved away from the dresser and back to her prisoner, who gave a great, wracking sob.\n\n“Why are you doing this?” choked Maggie.\n\n“Because I want to,” said the woman, her voice clipped and cultured, and a smile in her tone. She knelt down and looked critically at one of her captive’s forearms, wiping away the blood which had flowed there from the long, glistening, raw strip on her upper arm. She sounded engaged, musing, and interested all at once, as if she were taking part in some philosophical debate. “It’s my belief that Man is really a very simple machine. There are certain things he has to do - eating, sleeping...”\n\nHaving chosen her spot, she began to trace one of her pointed fingertips slowly along the skin, leaving a trail of raised furrows from which blood began to bead. There was a hiss of indrawn breath which she ignored.\n\n“Everything else is optional. Most people don’t realize that, not really. In spite of all the winging and whining about circumstance, there’s no one who could stop them from doing exactly what they wanted, if they tried,” she paused her tracing, and gesticulated with a claw. “I have a theory that people like being miserable. It’s the only explanation for the snowflake generation.” She frowned, and stuck the claw back into Maggie’s skin. “I could never understand the pleasure of it, myself. Torment now! Fear. Pain. Those I like. Much like you, I suppose.”\n\nThe woman had completed the light tracing of a perfect rectangle in her victim’s flesh, and was looking, with a critical eye, at the bleeding lines as she spoke.\n\nMaggie shook her head. “No. I’m not like that. Please let me go!”\n\nA bubbling little giggle escaped the rust-smeared face as it leered close to the bound woman, its attention diverted from the wounds to the eyes of the victim. “Hahaha! Oh tut! You of all people should realize the futility of pleading! Nothing can take the fun out of sadism like a stoic mindset, so please! Beg. Barter. Struggle. Scream! Hurt me, if you can! It won’t do you an atom of good, but it will make things a lot more entertaining for me!”\n\nAt the last word she dug her index claw back into the inflamed lines of the rectangle and began to go over it again, her victim’s breath coming in gasps and half-screams as the golden point tore through dermis and membrane.\n\nWith the rectangle complete, and the blood now flowing rather than beading, the redhead stood up from her squat and walked leisurely over to the dresser, wiping her hands on a rag as she went. After a little consideration, she pulled a tiny golden blade from the roll. It was shaped almost like a cheese-knife. As she turned back toward her captive, the song changed. A tight, high-pitched marching snare pattern began, accompanied by a bass melody and acoustic guitar.\n\nThe satisfied smirk which had gently twisting the torturer’s mouth widened into a full-toothed grin, and she reached back to turn up the volume to its loudest extent. A deep female voice began to sing, a slight reverberation making her sound unreal as the music bombarded the room.\n\n*One pill makes you larger / And one pill makes you small*\n\nThe redhead half hummed, half sang the words as she squatted down and, her clawed left hand pressing firmly down to keep the arm still, began to delicately insert the knife under the hypodermis.\n\n*And if you go chasing rabbits / And you know you’re gonna fall*\n\nMaggie screamed and tried to thrash, but her voice was lost in the bass and the voice, which grew in volume as the song progressed. It was the work of a minute to slice the perfect rectangle of skin from the arm. It came away, caught between the woman’s thumb and the blade like an apple peel, and she flicked it into a tin pail with the matching strip from the upper arm. Next she cut a flap from Maggie’s jeans and began tracing the hollow outline of several curly, rune-like symbols into her thigh with a claw.\n\nShe had just taken up a long-handled, scalpel-like implement with a golden blade, and was about to slice the skin from within the outlines, when the music faded out prior to changing songs, and a faint thump echoed through the momentary silence. The woman instantly rose and turned off the speaker, leaving a bloody smudge on the silver button as she did.\nTurning back to the hapless captive, she pressed one delicate looking claw against her lips, and passed a blood-grained finger across her own mouth.\n\nTerrified eyes stared up at her. Maggie could not move her head because of the claw, around which blood was already seeping from punctured lips, but she rose her eyebrows in assent. Her tormentor was not paying attention, however. She had her head cocked to one side, and her eyes looked vacantly at the floor as she listened intently. Then, evidently having made up her mind, she strode over to the door and opened it, revealing the beams of two flashlights, and drawing a startled exclamatory from one of the men in the hallway.\n\nThere were two of them, roughly the same in height, though not in girth. Bulky vests and light blue shirts betrayed them at once as policemen, but the vest could not disguise a certain chubbiness in the younger one. It made him look about twelve. Their guns were not drawn, and their looks of shock turned quickly to bewilderment and horror as they took in the blood-caked figure in front of them.\n\nThe redhead’s mouth shifted a trifle, her lips compressing for a split second. Then, before they could say anything, she raised her hands in front of her and extended the claws toward them slowly.\n\n“This is strapped to my wrist. I’m going to take it off. There are knives in that room,” she tilted her head toward the door from which she’d emerged, “but I have none on me. I’m unarmed.”\n\nAs she spoke, she slowly undid the clasp of the metal cuff, and slid the contrivance from her fingers before placing it on the ground. The tight rings had left white bands on her fingers, which stood out, ghastly against the streaky patina of bright red and dark rust.\n\nBy now the policemen had drawn their weapons, realizing that this was not the junkie squatter situation that they had expected. As they edged toward her, still not really masters of the situation, there came a cry from the room. The policemen glanced sharply at the door, and the older one nodded to his junior to have a look.\n\n“There is a woman in there,” said the woman calmly, as the first man stepped toward her. “Whatever you do, don’t untie her. I’ll explain it all, very carefully, but on no account is she to be released.”\n\nEven as she spoke, the younger of the pair gave an exclamation, and she heard the mingled sounds of her victim’s frightened and grateful whimperings, and the boy’s comforting assurances that “everything was alright,” which it clearly wasn’t.\n“I don’t know why I bother,” said the redhead, shaking her head as she listened to the boy struggling with her efficient knots.\n\nShe had put her hands out, meekly, to be cuffed, but as the man snapped the first bracelet in place she grabbed the collar of his vest and struck him hard on the nose with her forehead. He crumpled at once, but as she was freeing her hand there was a ragged, high-pitched scream, and a startled yell from the boy. She snatched up the golden cuff and ran into the room, brandishing it like an exceptionally short flail. Her captive was loose from the chair, struggling with the boy on the ground. A swift blow to the back of the head elicited another scream, as a kick shifted her off of the boy. As the screaming form scrambled to her feet, the redhead snatched up a knife from the soft-leather roll. The two lunged at each other, one snarling as if her throat would burst, the other perfectly silent. The knife shot forward, a steel streak in the gloom, punching through muscles, veins, and cartilage until it was hilt-deep in Maggie’s neck.\n\nThe scream stopped, and a hollow, gurgling, liquid-like choking sound came from the gaping mouth as the body staggered back under the momentum of the thrust. The redhead didn’t stop to watch, but bent over the boy. His face was riven with deep scratches, and one ear was horribly torn, but his throat, much to her surprise, was intact. He was staring straight ahead with unfocused eyes, his breath shallow, his limbs beginning to tremble.\n\nShe slapped him hard across the face, restoring purpose to his gaze, and forced his head up to face her.\n\n“Hey, you’re alive,” she said, bruskly, her eyes flickering to his neck where a crucifix hung on a short golden chain. “That makes you lucky.”\n\nHe looked at her dumbly, and then his gaze slid behind her, the lids widening to expose the whites of his eyes. The hissing gurgle in the background grew more urgent, then ceased. The redhead turned to see the bleeding blond rising to its feet. The knife was grasped in its hand, and the wound at its throat was closing rapidly, leaving only a vivid red splatter on its collar. Its teeth were bared, and a manic grin suffused its face. More blood was trickling through its hair from the unhealed wounds that the makeshift flail had inflicted, but it didn’t seem to care. A malevolence, wholly human in its intensity, yet without the associated restraint, radiated from the creature in perfume-like clouds.\n\n“Hypocrite!” it hissed through newly repaired vocal chords.\n\n“Absolutely,” said the redhead.\n\n“You try to kill me, and you defend that slug, when you admit that we’re alike.”\n\n“Alike. Yes. Well that’s the point, isn’t it?  What would I want with slugs when I can have an equal, like you?” With those words, she drew a hand from her cargo pocket and threw a handful of sparkling dust with all her might, straight into the blonde's face. It inhaled on reflex and instantly choked, falling to its knees as it tried to suck air into gold-encrusted lungs.\n\nThe redhead snapped her fingers at the policeman. “You! Keep her still!” she barked as she returned to the dresser and picked up the scalpel.\n\nHe didn’t move.\n\n“Now!” she snapped, grasping the slobbering figure by the shoulders. “Before she coughs it up!”\n\nHe flinched and moved forward as she threw the monster onto its back.\n\n“Put your weight on that leg and keep it as still as you can.”\n\nHe obeyed dumbly, and sat on the calf of the leg on which the sigils were traced. He placed his hands on the knee joint and leaned forward, preventing the leg from bending.\n\n“Good,” said the redhead, as she sat herself on the monster’s stomach, crushing it to the floor.\n\nIt took about two minutes to carve out the flesh from the traced outlines, but it felt like more. The struggles grew stronger and stronger, and by the time the last squiggle was hollowed out, they could barely keep her pinned down.\n\n“Ok, let go!” yelled the redhead.\n\nThe boy was sent flying by a kick as soon as he shifted his weight, and the redhead was instantly flipped onto her back with a set of vice-like hands wrapped about her throat. The grip lasted only a split second before the monster screamed in pain and rage and jerked away, the scalpel embedded in its hand. It yanked it free and began raining down blows upon the redhead pinned beneath it. The ragged, gasping breath became more and more labored, and after half a dozen punches, it fell forward, sprawling across the other woman.\n\n“My round, I think,” said the redhead, softly.\n\nIt was a few minutes before she collected her scattered wits and pushed the corpse from her. When at last she staggered to her feet, she found the boy unconscious against the wall. Within twenty minutes both he and his older colleague were locked in the mossy remains of the bathroom, safely out of the way. By the time they had both come around and broken out of their temporary prison, the only signs remaining of their adventure were a headache, several deep scratches,  some disturbances in the dust, and the smell of bleach in the front room.\n","date":"2019-04-22T16:57:35.210Z","updated":"2019-04-22T16:57:35.210Z","path":"skin.html","_id":"cjusl663k0004mr65a9jqpnc2","comments":1,"content":"<p>Some little way off of the main road stood what must once have been a pleasant home. It was modest enough in size, but had the advantage of land and privacy. It stood two stories tall in a sizable garden, shielded from the road by a line of trees and straggling bushes. The lawn was overgrown, long grass competing with high weeds for the soil, while fallen leaves and twigs lay strewn about, unheeded. The house was at an awkward stage in its decay, being clearly abandoned, but not yet decrepit. The windows were dark and lifeless, some bereft of their screens and storm windows, others playing host to the thick, sticky strands of the local arachnid population. Blinds hung in crooked and gap-toothed disarray in the windows, and across the tattered sheer curtains of one downstairs room, a light flickered, betraying the presence of some intruder. Both front and back doors had been padlocked to prevent occurrences such as this, but one of the capacious rear windows stood open, the snib having been forced back. From this aperture there came a cornucopia of sounds, muffled by a closed door which separated it from the curtained front room.

Riding on that smell, a strange, high note in the musky scent, was a  sharp, metallic tang. The source of this was a woman seated in an old-fashioned kitchen chair, intact despite its callus abandonment, and quite sturdy. Her arms were secured to those of the chair by chords at the wrists and the elbows. A rope passed under her arms, circling around her torso and the back of the seat, before being capably knotted. Her ankles were likewise tied to the legs of the chair, leaving her completely helpless. She could neither move, nor gain enough leverage to wriggle loose. Her mouth was free and hung open, sucking in air and issuing moans and little, choking sobs.

She wore military cargo pants and a black sleeveless T-shirt that showed the toned muscle of her shoulders. There were dark stains on her clothes, and speckles and smears of bright, rusty red on her arms. On her left hand there was a sparkle of metal which sent shimmers around the room whenever the light caught it. A thick metal cuff on her wrist sent five chains snaking down to a broad ring on the middle section of each finger.

There was a hiss of indrawn breath which she ignored.</p>\n<p>“Everything else is optional. Most people don’t realize that, not really. In spite of all the winging and whining about circumstance, there’s no one who could stop them from doing exactly what they wanted, if they tried,” she paused her tracing, and gesticulated with a claw. “I have a theory that people like being miserable. It’s the only explanation for the snowflake generation.” She frowned, and stuck the claw back into Maggie’s skin. “I could never understand the pleasure of it, myself. Torment now! Fear. Pain. Those I like. Much like you, I suppose.”</p>\n<p>The woman had completed the light tracing of a perfect rectangle in her victim’s flesh, and was looking, with a critical eye, at the bleeding lines as she spoke.</p>\n<p>Maggie shook her head. “No. I’m not like that. Please let me go!”</p>\n<p>A bubbling little giggle escaped the rust-smeared face as it leered close to the bound woman, its attention diverted from the wounds to the eyes of the victim. “Hahaha! Oh tut! You of all people should realize the futility of pleading! Nothing can take the fun out of sadism like a stoic mindset, so please! Beg. Barter. Struggle. Scream! Hurt me, if you can! It won’t do you an atom of good, but it will make things a lot more entertaining for me!”</p>\n<p>At the last word she dug her index claw back into the inflamed lines of the rectangle and began to go over it again, her victim’s breath coming in gasps and half-screams as the golden point tore through dermis and membrane.</p>\n<p>With the rectangle complete, and the blood now flowing rather than beading, the redhead stood up from her squat and walked leisurely over to the dresser, wiping her hands on a rag as she went. After a little consideration, she pulled a tiny golden blade from the roll. It was shaped almost like a cheese-knife. As she turned back toward her captive, the song changed. A tight, high-pitched marching snare pattern began, accompanied by a bass melody and acoustic guitar.</p>\n<p>The satisfied smirk which had gently twisting the torturer’s mouth widened into a full-toothed grin, and she reached back to turn up the volume to its loudest extent. A deep female voice began to sing, a slight reverberation making her sound unreal as the music bombarded the room.</p>\n<p><em>One pill makes you larger / And one pill makes you small</em></p>\n<p>The redhead half hummed, half sang the words as she squatted down and, her clawed left hand pressing firmly down to keep the arm still, began to delicately insert the knife under the hypodermis.</p>\n<p><em>And if you go chasing rabbits / And you know you’re gonna fall</em></p>\n<p>Maggie screamed and tried to thrash, but her voice was lost in the bass and the voice, which grew in volume as the song progressed. It was the work of a minute to slice the perfect rectangle of skin from the arm. It came away, caught between the woman’s thumb and the blade like an apple peel, and she flicked it into a tin pail with the matching strip from the upper arm. Next she cut a flap from Maggie’s jeans and began tracing the hollow outline of several curly, rune-like symbols into her thigh with a claw.</p>\n<p>She had just taken up a long-handled, scalpel-like implement with a golden blade, and was about to slice the skin from within the outlines, when the music faded out prior to changing songs, and a faint thump echoed through the momentary silence. The woman instantly rose and turned off the speaker, leaving a bloody smudge on the silver button as she did.<br>Turning back to the hapless captive, she pressed one delicate looking claw against her lips, and passed a blood-grained finger across her own mouth.</p>\n<p>Terrified eyes stared up at her. Maggie could not move her head because of the claw, around which blood was already seeping from punctured lips, but she rose her eyebrows in assent. Her tormentor was not paying attention, however. She had her head cocked to one side, and her eyes looked vacantly at the floor as she listened intently. Then, evidently having made up her mind, she strode over to the door and opened it, revealing the beams of two flashlights, and drawing a startled exclamatory from one of the men in the hallway.</p>\n<p>There were two of them, roughly the same in height, though not in girth. Bulky vests and light blue shirts betrayed them at once as policemen, but the vest could not disguise a certain chubbiness in the younger one. It made him look about twelve. Their guns were not drawn, and their looks of shock turned quickly to bewilderment and horror as they took in the blood-caked figure in front of them.</p>\n<p>The redhead’s mouth shifted a trifle, her lips compressing for a split second. Then, before they could say anything, she raised her hands in front of her and extended the claws toward them slowly.</p>\n<p>“This is strapped to my wrist. I’m going to take it off. There are knives in that room,” she tilted her head toward the door from which she’d emerged, “but I have none on me. I’m unarmed.”</p>\n<p>As she spoke, she slowly undid the clasp of the metal cuff, and slid the contrivance from her fingers before placing it on the ground. The tight rings had left white bands on her fingers, which stood out, ghastly against the streaky patina of bright red and dark rust.</p>\n<p>By now the policemen had drawn their weapons, realizing that this was not the junkie squatter situation that they had expected. As they edged toward her, still not really masters of the situation, there came a cry from the room. The policemen glanced sharply at the door, and the older one nodded to his junior to have a look.</p>\n<p>“There is a woman in there,” said the woman calmly, as the first man stepped toward her. “Whatever you do, don’t untie her. I’ll explain it all, very carefully, but on no account is she to be released.”</p>\n<p>Even as she spoke, the younger of the pair gave an exclamation, and she heard the mingled sounds of her victim’s frightened and grateful whimperings, and the boy’s comforting assurances that “everything was alright,” which it clearly wasn’t.<br>“I don’t know why I bother,” said the redhead, shaking her head as she listened to the boy struggling with her efficient knots.</p>\n<p>She had put her hands out, meekly, to be cuffed, but as the man snapped the first bracelet in place she grabbed the collar of his vest and struck him hard on the nose with her forehead. He crumpled at once, but as she was freeing her hand there was a ragged, high-pitched scream, and a startled yell from the boy. She snatched up the golden cuff and ran into the room, brandishing it like an exceptionally short flail. Her captive was loose from the chair, struggling with the boy on the ground. A swift blow to the back of the head elicited another scream, as a kick shifted her off of the boy. As the screaming form scrambled to her feet, the redhead snatched up a knife from the soft-leather roll. The two lunged at each other, one snarling as if her throat would burst, the other perfectly silent. The knife shot forward, a steel streak in the gloom, punching through muscles, veins, and cartilage until it was hilt-deep in Maggie’s neck.</p>\n<p>The scream stopped, and a hollow, gurgling, liquid-like choking sound came from the gaping mouth as the body staggered back under the momentum of the thrust. The redhead didn’t stop to watch, but bent over the boy. His face was riven with deep scratches, and one ear was horribly torn, but his throat, much to her surprise, was intact. He was staring straight ahead with unfocused eyes, his breath shallow, his limbs beginning to tremble.</p>\n<p>She slapped him hard across the face, restoring purpose to his gaze, and forced his head up to face her.</p>\n<p>“Hey, you’re alive,” she said, bruskly, her eyes flickering to his neck where a crucifix hung on a short golden chain. “That makes you lucky.”</p>\n<p>He looked at her dumbly, and then his gaze slid behind her, the lids widening to expose the whites of his eyes. The hissing gurgle in the background grew more urgent, then ceased. The redhead turned to see the bleeding blond rising to its feet. The knife was grasped in its hand, and the wound at its throat was closing rapidly, leaving only a vivid red splatter on its collar. Its teeth were bared, and a manic grin suffused its face. More blood was trickling through its hair from the unhealed wounds that the makeshift flail had inflicted, but it didn’t seem to care. A malevolence, wholly human in its intensity, yet without the associated restraint, radiated from the creature in perfume-like clouds.</p>\n<p>“Hypocrite!” it hissed through newly repaired vocal chords.</p>\n<p>“Absolutely,” said the redhead.</p>\n<p>“You try to kill me, and you defend that slug, when you admit that we’re alike.”</p>\n<p>“Alike. Yes. Well that’s the point, isn’t it?  What would I want with slugs when I can have an equal, like you?” With those words, she drew a hand from her cargo pocket and threw a handful of sparkling dust with all her might, straight into the blonde’s face. It inhaled on reflex and instantly choked, falling to its knees as it tried to suck air into gold-encrusted lungs.</p>\n<p>The redhead snapped her fingers at the policeman. “You! Keep her still!” she barked as she returned to the dresser and picked up the scalpel.</p>\n<p>He didn’t move.</p>\n<p>“Now!” she snapped, grasping the slobbering figure by the shoulders. “Before she coughs it up!”</p>\n<p>He flinched and moved forward as she threw the monster onto its back.</p>\n<p>“Put your weight on that leg and keep it as still as you can.”</p>\n<p>He obeyed dumbly, and sat on the calf of the leg on which the sigils were traced. He placed his hands on the knee joint and leaned forward, preventing the leg from bending.</p>\n<p>“Good,” said the redhead, as she sat herself on the monster’s stomach, crushing it to the floor.</p>\n<p>It took about two minutes to carve out the flesh from the traced outlines, but it felt like more. The struggles grew stronger and stronger, and by the time the last squiggle was hollowed out, they could barely keep her pinned down.</p>\n<p>“Ok, let go!” yelled the redhead.</p>\n<p>The boy was sent flying by a kick as soon as he shifted his weight, and the redhead was instantly flipped onto her back with a set of vice-like hands wrapped about her throat. The grip lasted only a split second before the monster screamed in pain and rage and jerked away, the scalpel embedded in its hand. It yanked it free and began raining down blows upon the redhead pinned beneath it. The ragged, gasping breath became more and more labored, and after half a dozen punches, it fell forward, sprawling across the other woman.</p>\n<p>“My round, I think,” said the redhead, softly.</p>\n<p>It was a few minutes before she collected her scattered wits and pushed the corpse from her. When at last she staggered to her feet, she found the boy unconscious against the wall. Within twenty minutes both he and his older colleague were locked in the mossy remains of the bathroom, safely out of the way. By the time they had both come around and broken out of their temporary prison, the only signs remaining of their adventure were a headache, several deep scratches,  some disturbances in the dust, and the smell of bleach in the front room.</p>\n"},{"title":"The Cannoli Catastrophe","author":"Kristal Rivera","headerimage":"img/header-thecannolicatastrophe.jpg","accenttext":"“How can I run an Italian bakery without any cannoli, am I right?”","layout":"article","_content":"Could you believe this guy? He’s nuts, this guy! Does he really think he can come into my place of business and tell me how to run it? Tell me what to sell? This guy thinks he has the biggest balls in town but let me tell you something, he doesn’t! I’ll give it to him, he’s a tough guy, until he sees the balls that I’m packing! Pardon my manners. This guy drives me nuts. How you doin’? The name is Sonny, Sonny Caparelli. I own a bakery right here in Belmont. Can’t get any better than the West Bronx. I grew up in this neighborhood. Back in the days, there were all kinds of restaurants and pastry shops all over.   Every day after school, I would go down to one of the shops to buy me some cannoli. I was a fat kid, let me tell you. What can I say? My mother used to spoil me! I was her baby! She died when I was thirteen years old so I had to grow up fast and earn some money, if you know what I mean. I went from momma’s boy, to the most feared man in the city. The real name’s Vincenzo, but everyone calls me Sonny. How’d I get the name youse might be wondering? Well if you mess with me, I’ll make sure you see the light at the end of the tunnel. I also got the name because of my bright personality that youse can feel through my smooth talking right now.\n\nAnyways, let me tell youse what happened. Later on in my life, I traded the guns for the balls I have now. I used my money to buy a bakery. I called it Sonny’s Sweets. What can I say? I’m still a fat kid on the inside. Everybody loves my baked goods. Not only do I sell goodies, but I also sell sandwiches and pizza. I know, I know. It’s weird to sell both but what can you do? My people wanted this from me and I love them so I’ll gladly do it for them. In remembrance of my late mother, I’ve decided to add cannoli on the menu. How can I run an Italian bakery without any cannoli, am I right? Well I guess the tough guy up a couple blocks thinks I’m nuts for putting them in my shop. His name is Lorenzo Barone. I used to run into trouble with him growing up. He’s always been in the same business as me. Now that we’re adults, we both own a bakery, except he only sells baked goods. His shop is famous for his cannoli, like if I give a damn. The difference between me and him is that I have more respect from the people because I don’t back down from a challenge. He really thought he could tell me what I can and can’t sell in my shop. I’m telling you this guy’s nuts! He confronted me about a week ago with his cute little crew that are filled with punks whose mouths are bigger than their fists. I could never understand how someone can have a crew so scrawny. Oh come on! I’m not judging them, but I’ve seen skinny people with heart. The only thing they have are nice clothes and good looks.\n\nHe walked in my shop with this look like he’s ready to go. Like me, he likes to look good and presentable. He’s got this slicked back, greasy, dark hair with his little curl falling down on his forehead thinking he’s Elvis Presley or something. He walked in with this suit and gold ring on his pinky. He chews his gum in the most disgusting way and it makes me want to smack him. He had the guts to spit his gum out on my floor, thinking and thought he could get away with it. My guys came out from the back and pinned his little sorry self to the wall. His crew headed straight for the doors, couple of punks. I wasn’t kidding, they have no hearts. They walk in with their chests big but run out when they see my men. Before I tell youse what happened, understand that I’m not dressing or looking like some momo like I am now. I came out from behind the counter with my all black suit and my beautiful black Italian loafers on like a true business man. I look like I can be Sylvester Stallone’s brother. He was my inspiration growing up. I wanted to be as big as that guy. Plus, I dare you to look at this face and tell me I’m not a good looking guy. These are the looks men dream of having! Anyways, I came from behind the counter with a toothpick in my mouth and I says to him,\n\n“You got a lot of nerve coming into my shop the way you did, Chicken Little.” The guy hates when I call him that, but it’s true. As big as he is, he doesn’t have the heart that I have. This guy runs from any confrontations and goes from big to little in a matter of seconds. So I don’t understand why he came into my shop and disrespected my floors the way he did. So this guy tells me,\n“I hear you were selling cannoli so I needed to give you a warning.”\n\n“HA! You hear this guy? Who does he think he is to tell me he’s giving me a warning?” All of my crew laughed at how stupid he sounded. No one dares come into my shop and talk to me the way he talked to me. People knows me, knows my crew, and knows what we do to people who feels the need to step out of line with me.\n\n“I came in here to give you a warning! You’re a tough guy standing behind your men. I’d like to see you coming up to me. I bet you can’t do it can you? That’s what I thought!” I laughed so hard that my six pack now has a six pack. I’m telling you his mouth is bigger than his fist. I let him talk because he can’t handle what I had coming for him. So I tell him,\n\n“Hey! Chicken Little! Enough of the small talk and tell me what the hell you’re really doing here, will you? I got things to oversee, baked goods to sell, and people to talk to! You’re wasting my time here!”\n\n“I’m here to tell you to stop selling your damn cannoli! The cannoli is my specialty and it’s a disrespect to think you can sell your nasty cannoli now that you see my business is doing way better than yours!”\n\nAll I can tell youse is that I slapped this stronzo so hard that his future generation could feel it. Don’t know what it means? Look it up it isn’t that difficult to figure it out. This is what happens when you trade your guns for the baked goods. People think they can walk all over you. They think they’re the tough guy now, making all the calls around here. He’s forgetting who I am. I’m Sonny Caparelli, and don’t you forget about it either. Oh, and his little outburst from earlier about who’s the real tough guy? I had to show him who owns the streets still. I grabbed this guy by his suit and I says to him,\n\n“Don’t you dare disrespect my shop and my mother’s recipe, do you understand me? If I want to sell the cannoli she’s taught me to make, then I’ll sell the damn cannoli! A real man will outsell more cannoli and show me who’s got more money in their pockets. A real man fights with his business and not with his mouth, capisci?” I dropped this pazzo and told my crew to get him the fuck out of here!\n\nSo three days after that, I was at the bar that I run as well. Me and my crew get our business handled there. What can I say? Did you honestly think I completely traded all my business for the bakery? I might’ve left the streets but the streets will never leave me. No one can do what Sonny Caparelli can do. I have to show these stronzos how things need to be handled. The bar allows us to keep our testosterone intact since we bake all damn day. I got all different size men in my crew, I don’t discriminate. I even have skinny people in my crew, but at least they have heart. My crew is a representation of me so of course they all dress good. Can’t have my peoples looking stupid out here. Even if my men have their work clothes on at the shop, they can still knock someone out.\n\nAnyways, I got a call from my man Ghost and he told me that someone trashed my bakery. We call him Ghost because he knows anything about everything but is never seen when anything happens. He’s usually standing around the neighborhood with a cigarette in his mouth and his tilted hat on, small in size but he knows what there is to know. He’s been a part of my crew since I was on the streets. He told me it was Chicken Little and his punk of a crew, so I told my men to get ready for what’s coming for us. I made a couple of my mother’s cannoli and attached a little note to it, like the classy man I am. What I wrote to this guy was:\n\n*You think you’ve got cazzi bigger than mine? We’ll see who the last guy standing is. I told you before, the tougher guy is the one who works the hardest. A real man is the one who sees competition as no competition. Come to my bar and we’ll see who the real tough guy is stronzo.*\n        *-Sonny Caparelli*\n\nEarlier today Mr. Tough Guy came into the bar to settle this little game he had going on. It wouldn’t be right if I didn’t show this guy who’s the real boss around here. He walked in the bar with his men strapped down ready to go. I had two of my guys stand by the front doors. When everyone walked in, they both shut and locked the doors. My guys came in and brought at least four big buckets up of our weapons. Chicken Little’s crew only brought two. I says to him,\n\n“You think you’re prepared tough guy?”\n\n“Don’t worry Sonny! I always come prepared!” My crew laughs at how ridiculous this guy sounds.\n\n   “So you really think your balls are bigger than mine huh? Well don’t tell me, show me!”\n\nWe opened our buckets and they opened theirs. And so our fight began. Chicken Little threw the first meatball. It was cute, but like I kept saying, mine was bigger. What? Did you momos think it was going to be a gun war or something? I told you I traded my guns for balls. I always had the heart people! I was never a punk! I just didn’t want to have any more blood on my hands. Plus, you gotta fight over a food business with food, am I right? Oh come on! I don’t want any of youse looking at me like that! I wasn’t going to kill the man over some cannoli! Youse are all nuts if you thought that!\n\nI wish I could’ve recorded this fight so youse can see it. When I think about it, all I can hear is Frank Sinatra singing “I did it my way,” as these men were getting hit in the head with meatballs in slow motion. One of Chicken Little’s men got knocked out with a meatball. How does someone get knocked out with a meatball? The hell if I know. I told you his peoples are weak. Anyways, to sum up what happened, his little crew went flying out the bar when they ran out of meatballs. We all looked ridiculous. This might sound crazy, but let’s be real here. We all had to grow up fast, but it doesn’t mean we aren’t all some big kids here. They left Lorenzo to fend for himself. He was on the floor, out of breath and pissed. After every one of his crew members left, I went up to this guy and I says to him,\n\n“How does it feel to be a losing man? When you’re too busy worrying about what the next man is doing, you’ll never run a business right.” I stuck my hand out to this momo and helped him up. He already looked stupid on the floor so I didn’t want to give him any more hell than he gave himself. So I looked him in the eye and I says to this guy,\n\n“Don’t you ever disrespect my place again! My name is Sonny Caparelli and don’t you forget about it!”\n","source":"thecannolicatatstrophe.md","raw":"---\ntitle: The Cannoli Catastrophe\nauthor: Kristal Rivera\nheaderimage: img/header-thecannolicatastrophe.jpg\naccenttext: “How can I run an Italian bakery without any cannoli, am I right?”\nlayout: article \n---\nCould you believe this guy?

Come to my bar and we’ll see who the real tough guy is stronzo.*\n        *-Sonny Caparelli*\n\nEarlier today Mr. Tough Guy came into the bar to settle this little game he had going on. It wouldn’t be right if I didn’t show this guy who’s the real boss around here. He walked in the bar with his men strapped down ready to go. I had two of my guys stand by the front doors. When everyone walked in, they both shut and locked the doors. My guys came in and brought at least four big buckets up of our weapons. Chicken Little’s crew only brought two. I says to him,\n\n“You think you’re prepared tough guy?”\n\n“Don’t worry Sonny! I always come prepared!” My crew laughs at how ridiculous this guy sounds.\n\n   “So you really think your balls are bigger than mine huh? Well don’t tell me, show me!”\n\nWe opened our buckets and they opened theirs. And so our fight began. Chicken Little threw the first meatball. It was cute, but like I kept saying, mine was bigger. What? Did you momos think it was going to be a gun war or something? I told you I traded my guns for balls. I always had the heart people! I was never a punk! I just didn’t want to have any more blood on my hands. Plus, you gotta fight over a food business with food, am I right? Oh come on! I don’t want any of youse looking at me like that! I wasn’t going to kill the man over some cannoli! Youse are all nuts if you thought that!\n\nI wish I could’ve recorded this fight so youse can see it. When I think about it, all I can hear is Frank Sinatra singing “I did it my way,” as these men were getting hit in the head with meatballs in slow motion. One of Chicken Little’s men got knocked out with a meatball. How does someone get knocked out with a meatball? The hell if I know. I told you his peoples are weak. Anyways, to sum up what happened, his little crew went flying out the bar when they ran out of meatballs. We all looked ridiculous. This might sound crazy, but let’s be real here. We all had to grow up fast, but it doesn’t mean we aren’t all some big kids here. They left Lorenzo to fend for himself. He was on the floor, out of breath and pissed. After every one of his crew members left, I went up to this guy and I says to him,\n\n“How does it feel to be a losing man? When you’re too busy worrying about what the next man is doing, you’ll never run a business right.” I stuck my hand out to this momo and helped him up. He already looked stupid on the floor so I didn’t want to give him any more hell than he gave himself. So I looked him in the eye and I says to this guy,\n\n“Don’t you ever disrespect my place again! My name is Sonny Caparelli and don’t you forget about it!”\n","date":"2019-04-22T16:57:40.016Z","updated":"2019-04-22T16:57:40.016Z","path":"thecannolicatatstrophe.html","_id":"cjusl663l0005mr6504kfa8x8","comments":1,"content":"<p>Could you believe this guy? He’s nuts, this guy! Does he really think he can come into my place of business and tell me how to run it? Tell me what to sell? This guy thinks he has the biggest balls in town but let me tell you something, he doesn’t! I’ll give it to him, he’s a tough guy, until he sees the balls that I’m packing! Pardon my manners. This guy drives me nuts. How you doin’? The name is Sonny, Sonny Caparelli. I own a bakery right here in Belmont. Can’t get any better than the West Bronx. I grew up in this neighborhood. Back in the days, there were all kinds of restaurants and pastry shops all over.   Every day after school, I would go down to one of the shops to buy me some cannoli. I was a fat kid, let me tell you. What can I say? My mother used to spoil me! I was her baby! She died when I was thirteen years old so I had to grow up fast and earn some money, if you know what I mean. I went from momma’s boy, to the most feared man in the city. The real name’s Vincenzo, but everyone calls me Sonny. How’d I get the name youse might be wondering? Well if you mess with me, I’ll make sure you see the light at the end of the tunnel. I also got the name because of my bright personality that youse can feel through my smooth talking right now.</p>\n<p>Anyways, let me tell youse what happened. Later on in my life, I traded the guns for the balls I have now. I used my money to buy a bakery. I called it Sonny’s Sweets. What can I say? I’m still a fat kid on the inside. Everybody loves my baked goods. Not only do I sell goodies, but I also sell sandwiches and pizza. I know, I know. It’s weird to sell both but what can you do? My people wanted this from me and I love them so I’ll gladly do it for them. In remembrance of my late mother, I’ve decided to add cannoli on the menu. How can I run an Italian bakery without any cannoli, am I right? Well I guess the tough guy up a couple blocks thinks I’m nuts for putting them in my shop. His name is Lorenzo Barone. I used to run into trouble with him growing up. He’s always been in the same business as me. Now that we’re adults, we both own a bakery, except he only sells baked goods. His shop is famous for his cannoli, like if I give a damn. The difference between me and him is that I have more respect from the people because I don’t back down from a challenge. He really thought he could tell me what I can and can’t sell in my shop. I’m telling you this guy’s nuts! He confronted me about a week ago with his cute little crew that are filled with punks whose mouths are bigger than their fists. I could never understand how someone can have a crew so scrawny. Oh come on! I’m not judging them, but I’ve seen skinny people with heart. The only thing they have are nice clothes and good looks.</p>\n<p>He walked in my shop with this look like he’s ready to go. Like me, he likes to look good and presentable. He’s got this slicked back, greasy, dark hair with his little curl falling down on his forehead thinking he’s Elvis Presley or something. He walked in with this suit and gold ring on his pinky. He chews his gum in the most disgusting way and it makes me want to smack him. He had the guts to spit his gum out on my floor, thinking and thought he could get away with it. My guys came out from the back and pinned his little sorry self to the wall. His crew headed straight for the doors, couple of punks. I wasn’t kidding, they have no hearts. They walk in with their chests big but run out when they see my men. Before I tell youse what happened, understand that I’m not dressing or looking like some momo like I am now. I came out from behind the counter with my all black suit and my beautiful black Italian loafers on like a true business man. I look like I can be Sylvester Stallone’s brother. He was my inspiration growing up. I wanted to be as big as that guy. Plus, I dare you to look at this face and tell me I’m not a good looking guy. These are the looks men dream of having! Anyways, I came from behind the counter with a toothpick in my mouth and I says to him,</p>\n<p>“You got a lot of nerve coming into my shop the way you did, Chicken Little.” The guy hates when I call him that, but it’s true. As big as he is, he doesn’t have the heart that I have. This guy runs from any confrontations and goes from big to little in a matter of seconds. So I don’t understand why he came into my shop and disrespected my floors the way he did. So this guy tells me,<br>“I hear you were selling cannoli so I needed to give you a warning.”</p>\n<p>“HA! You hear this guy? Who does he think he is to tell me he’s giving me a warning?” All of my crew laughed at how stupid he sounded. No one dares come into my shop and talk to me the way he talked to me. People knows me, knows my crew, and knows what we do to people who feels the need to step out of line with me.</p>\n<p>“I came in here to give you a warning! You’re a tough guy standing behind your men. I’d like to see you coming up to me. I bet you can’t do it can you? That’s what I thought!” I laughed so hard that my six pack now has a six pack. I’m telling you his mouth is bigger than his fist. I let him talk because he can’t handle what I had coming for him. So I tell him,</p>\n<p>“Hey! Chicken Little! Enough of the small talk and tell me what the hell you’re really doing here, will you? I got things to oversee, baked goods to sell, and people to talk to! You’re wasting my time here!”</p>\n<p>“I’m here to tell you to stop selling your damn cannoli! The cannoli is my specialty and it’s a disrespect to think you can sell your nasty cannoli now that you see my business is doing way better than yours!”</p>\n<p>All I can tell youse is that I slapped this stronzo so hard that his future generation could feel it. Don’t know what it means? Look it up it isn’t that difficult to figure it out. This is what happens when you trade your guns for the baked goods. People think they can walk all over you. They think they’re the tough guy now, making all the calls around here. He’s forgetting who I am. I’m Sonny Caparelli, and don’t you forget about it either. Oh, and his little outburst from earlier about who’s the real tough guy? I had to show him who owns the streets still. I grabbed this guy by his suit and I says to him,</p>\n<p>“Don’t you dare disrespect my shop and my mother’s recipe, do you understand me? If I want to sell the cannoli she’s taught me to make, then I’ll sell the damn cannoli! A real man will outsell more cannoli and show me who’s got more money in their pockets. A real man fights with his business and not with his mouth, capisci?” I dropped this pazzo and told my crew to get him the fuck out of here!</p>\n<p>So three days after that, I was at the bar that I run as well. Me and my crew get our business handled there. What can I say? Did you honestly think I completely traded all my business for the bakery? I might’ve left the streets but the streets will never leave me. No one can do what Sonny Caparelli can do. I have to show these stronzos how things need to be handled. The bar allows us to keep our testosterone intact since we bake all damn day. I got all different size men in my crew, I don’t discriminate. I even have skinny people in my crew, but at least they have heart. My crew is a representation of me so of course they all dress good. Can’t have my peoples looking stupid out here. Even if my men have their work clothes on at the shop, they can still knock someone out.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I got a call from my man Ghost and he told me that someone trashed my bakery. We call him Ghost because he knows anything about everything but is never seen when anything happens. He’s usually standing around the neighborhood with a cigarette in his mouth and his tilted hat on, small in size but he knows what there is to know. He’s been a part of my crew since I was on the streets. He told me it was Chicken Little and his punk of a crew, so I told my men to get ready for what’s coming for us. I made a couple of my mother’s cannoli and attached a little note to it, like the classy man I am. What I wrote to this guy was:</p>\n<p><em>You think you’ve got cazzi bigger than mine?

Grendel and his mother, along with the fire-dragon, are usually what readers recall about the poem. We often remember the monsters in media more so than the hero, but why is that? Many can easily recall such fearsome adversaries as Smaug, the dragon from *The Hobbit*, the Kraken from *Clash of the Titans*, and the Monster from *Frankenstein*. All of them stand out far more than the protagonists of their stories. It is possible that these creatures represent long-buried aspects of our psyche, thereby speaking to humans on a primal level. They may also serve as incarnations of the other; emissaries from the world that remain just out of sight. Or perhaps, we as a people have an innate desire to create entities to compare ourselves to in order to reassure ourselves about what we hope is our rightful superiority in the world. Through examining the role of the monster in various writings and media, this paper unearths the similarities that connect them across many tales and stories as well as deciphering the hidden importance of monsters.\n\nIn order to closely examine what they may represent, it’s likely that an overview of the monsters within *Beowulf* would be helpful. The monsters in *Beowulf* are notoriously undefined, with very few actual descriptions. Grendel and his mother are descended from all manner of strange beings: giants, elves, and ogres. They were brought down from Cain, the first murderer. One aspect that is certain are Grendel’s glowing eyes, a common feature among humanoid monsters that originate in northern England. The dragon stretches over 50-feet in length, but remains uncertain beyond that.\n\nYet the poet of *Beowulf*  reaches beyond limitations of presentation, revealing the inner thoughts of his monsters. Grendel is not a mindless creature, striking at random, but is instead described as acting upon a grudge. The raucous gathering of Danish warriors in King Hrothgar’s new mead hall disturbs him from his seclusion in the wilderness. Grendel’s mother acts according to the honored tradition of blood feud over the slaying of her son. Even the reptilian dragon possesses an interior motivation; we see it obsessively rage over a stolen goblet. We would not be surprised to see such humanizing techniques in a modern horror story, yet this story is over a thousand years old, and is fascinating in its prescience. This aspect of the poem has led to many adaptations that focus on Grendel, the monstrous star of the poem, with varying degrees of success. One notable example of the concept done well is John Gardner’s award-winning novel simply titled *Grendel*. This work follows the story of Beowulf from the monster’s perspective, presenting a contrast to the warlike Beowulf, in the philosophical Grendel. Having a monster as a protagonist is the pinnacle of creating empathy, and we are given a front-row seat to Grendel’s search for purpose in a seemingly uncaring world. In the end of the novel, our “hero” is reduced to a gibbering wreck after his confrontation with an almost demonic Beowulf, using his last breath to pronounce a curse upon mankind; “Poor Grendel’s had an accident. So may you all” (Gardner 174).\n\nDespite their exaggerated and frightening features, monsters are often shown to have some small portion of humanity, either in how they act or how they look. This can result in the monsters acting as reflections or representations of different aspects of our psyche. Noted medievalist Jeffrey Cohen was of the opinion that monsters, particularly those that resemble humans, raised questions about our own concepts of identity. He was especially interested in how giants can be considered both human and something other, which is both pre-human and post-human in nature (Cohen 11). Giants appear multiple times across ancient texts, including the Bible, and usually seem to be representations of a time before the rise of humanity, when the world was younger and pristine. This would potentially transform the stories about human heroes slaying giant foes into an allegory for overcoming one’s past in an effort to grow beyond into something new.\n\n*Beowulf* displays another way monsters can represent parts of humanity, by drawing repeated parallels between Beowulf himself, and the enemies he faces. Grendel and Beowulf are described using similar, even identical terms. For example, they are both characterized as having the strength of 30 men in their arms. When Beowulf does fight human champions, like the Frankish Dæghrefn, his methods are distinctly inhuman, almost monstrous (Orchard 33). Thus, Grendel serves as a dark reflection of what Beowulf might have been, had he forgone all trappings of society- a ravenous, unstoppable menace. The theme of reflection is prevalent throughout the poem, with the mother of Grendel’s watery home being described as a kind of hall, with Beowulf taking the role as invading aggressor in place of Grendel. This flipping of the roles is interesting, as it has Beowulf essentially sinking down to the level of his monstrous foe. Yet ultimately he overcomes the monster, rising to the surface of the swamp grown stronger from his experience. The dragon, fought much later in Beowulf’s life after he has been crowned king, embodies ideals that are the antithesis of what makes a good ruler- unchecked avarice and blind rage at every perceived slight. During their battle, the adjectives between Beowulf and the wyrm are blurred together, both being described with a term that roughly translates to “awe-inspiring,” or “combatant”. The two adversaries eventually kill each other, their bodies intertwined. Beowulf succumbs to the venomous bite of the dragon, and the reptile is finished by a stab through the eye. Monsters, in the context of *Beowulf*, can then be seen as shadows of Beowulf and his culture, showing the consequences of rejecting society, even twisting the peoples’ traditions to serve their own needs. Perhaps the author intended them to act as a warning to not allow oneself to be consumed by base desires and petty grudges, as these feelings and actions themselves could be considered monstrous. However, the final fate of the aging hero portrays a somber, yet nuanced proposition: that completely overcoming one’s own monstrosity is actually impossible without destroying oneself in the process.\n\nMonsters, particularly those displayed in travelogues, can be said to be representations of the other and the exotic, inhabiting worlds that are out of sight. In medieval culture they could be said to mark boundaries, both geographical, such as on maps of the world, and anatomical, blurring the lines between human and animal. The allure of potentially seeing these wondrous beasts was likely a driving force behind many of the exploratory and trade expeditions that were undertaken at the time. Monsters can also be seen acting on the complete opposite intention. On the famous *mappaemundi*, or maps of the world, terrifying sea monsters prowl the waters at the peripheries of the map itself, marking off the boundaries of what was known, possibly deterring sailors from traveling beyond those points. The actual dangers may have been more mundane, such as waterspouts or exposed reefs, but the sea beasts likely demanded people’s attention for a more suitable first impression. Therefore, as markers, monsters may have acted as cautionary signs, intended to keep people from venturing too far from civilization or accepted traditions. Some humanoid monsters, such as the Donestre, with their twisted and animalistic features, were taken to be warnings of what could happen to those who strayed from the teachings of God, becoming as warped physically as they were supposedly spiritually. Indeed, Saint Isidore of Seville trace the word *monster* to the Latin *monere*, ‘to warn’, and he suggested that monsters were a warning from God against deviation (Mittman 337). This may partially explain why monsters were considered to be relegated to the distant reaches of the world, having been banished there for violating natural and cultural norms. Saint Augustine had another theory about the root of the word. He traced it to *monstrare*, “to show,” and declared that monsters were meant to be a demonstration of God’s powers, marking them as necessary parts of the natural order .Monsters, then, could act as both attraction and deterrent, sparking the imagination of entrepreneurs looking to travel to distant lands, while also frightening the “common folk” away from straying too far off the beaten path, lest they be killed in a myriad of gruesome ways. This duality of being both alluring and repulsive seems to be an inherent aspect of the very nature of monstrosity.\n\nThis idea of monsters being from outside the bounds of the normal world appears in *Beowulf* as well. Grendel and his mother live beneath a marsh far outside Hrothgar’s holdings. They had apparently been dwelling relatively peacefully there for years, before being disturbed by the construction of Heorot. Grendel is even described as a “marsh-stepper” and “border-walker”, further emphasizing his separation from the world of man. His crossing over from his world through the boundaries of Hrothgar’s hall is shown to be an unwelcome and violent attack on the neighboring world of the Danes. Beowulf, monstrous in his physical prowess, is also an outsider, coming from distant Geatland over the ocean waves to aid Hrothgar. This makes Beowulf himself a wondrous being from the lands beyond Daneland, further emphasizing his similarities to his adversaries. He then crosses another boundary, that of the cavernous lair of Grendel’s mother, this time acting as an outside force, much as Grendel did before him. Beowulf is almost killed by Grendel’s mother for his trespass, being saved by what could only be described as a *deus ex machina*. The dragon incident is another example of borders not being respected, as a thief carelessly invades its lair and carries away a piece of the hoard stashed there, causing the dragon to awaken in a fiery fury. The dragon then departs from its remote lair and terrorizes the people of Geatland, continuing the cycle of disrespecting the boundaries of others’ homelands. After defeating this invader, Beowulf’s final triumph could be argued to be the posthumous erection of his own tomb at the headland, the border, a final way of using his body to mark off his world from that of the monstrous. (Mittman 341) So, in the end, Beowulf, with his prodigious strength, marks the boundary between man and monster, both conceptually, as he displays certain monstrous attributes, and physically, with his tomb acting as a marker for the boundaries of his kingdom.\n\nThe slaying of a monster is often used as a hero’s final obstacle during his journey. By defeating an enemy greater than themselves, he or she shows the growth they experienced over the course of their travels. Monsters are also useful in representing abstract concepts, such as evil and darkness, so by overcoming them, the hero triumphs over evil itself. J.R.R Tolkien was extremely proficient in creating monsters that were embodiments of dark forces that must be combatted. The theme of monstrous creatures of shadow is one of the main elements of Tolkien’s epic *The Lord of the Rings* and its extensions. One of the best examples is Ungoliant, from *The Silmarillion*, who is a “darkness made visible” monster in the shape of a gargantuan spider. (Bergen 110) Another is the demonic Balrog that menaces the Fellowship while they’re traveling through the abandoned mines of Moria. The Balrog is described as being composed of “shadow and flame” in the vague shape of a humanoid figure, and is only defeated by the sacrifice of the party’s most powerful member, Gandalf, the wizard. Tolkien was very clear about his monsters being intended as embodiments of pure malice and corruption, with no effort made to show any humanizing or empathetic aspects to them. The heroes simply must defeat them, as failure to do so would plunge the world into a shadowy grave. In this context, the monster is merely an obstacle, a physical representation of all the evil in the world that the hero must face.\n\nTolkien was also one of the first scholars to argue that the monsters in Beowulf were an essential part of the story, with his contemporaries focusing more on the scarcer historical elements. They felt that the monster fights were “trite” and “unseemly”, but Tolkien disagreed. He argued that the conflict between heroes such as Beowulf, and monsters like Grendel and the dragon, provided important examples of the ever present struggle between good and evil in the world at large. Tolkien, who had been fascinated with dragons since he was a child, also examined the significance of the battle with the mighty beast. “Something more significant than a standard hero, a man faced with a foe more evil than any human enemy of house or realm…” (Tolkien 17) This concept of monsters, particularly dragons, being so far beyond normal man that only a true hero can defeat them, appears multiple times across medieval and Anglo-Saxon literature. In biblical and patristic texts, the dragon features as one of the most common symbols of evil, functioning as a formidable and monstrous adversary of God, man and beast alike. (Rauer 52) Medievalist Christine Rauer compared dozens of dragon fights with the one that takes place in *Beowulf*, and found several elements shared between them, such as the invasion of the beast’s lair, the dragon’s magnificent treasure hoard, and the ways it is finally defeated, usually with a stab to the underbelly. The dragon perfectly fits the role of a final trial for an aspiring hero, as it combines the most dangerous parts of wild beasts, including the venomous fangs of a serpent and the talons of a massive bird-of-prey, with the perils of a raging inferno. Some scholars have theorized that dragons are a creation of humanity’s subconscious, an amalgamation of the predators we faced during our development as a species. A foe such as this, a primordial incarnation of fear, greed, and power, could only be defeated by one showing true courage and strength. Tales of dragon slayers serve as lessons meant to remind us that those who show bravery can overcome any opponent, no matter how monstrous.\n\nAs we have seen, monsters have played many important roles throughout our stories and literature. They can represent deeply hidden aspects of ourselves, reminding us of the potential danger that comes from giving in to our own primal urges. Monsters can also be seen as parallels to the heroes that face them, helping to provide contrast between what is seen as acceptable, and what is monstrous. We take them as an example of what not to do in a civilized context. Another aspect of wondrous and monstrous creatures is that they can be beneficial, drawing in daring adventurers with whispers of their presence in uncharted lands. These same stories of half-man, half-beasts frighten away the faint of heart from potentially dangerous locales, as well as acting as a teaching tool of what happens to those who do not heed the word of God. Arguably the most important role of the monster, though, is to be an enemy whose defeat inspires us to be like the heroes of old. They are embodiments of the trials we have faced to ensure our relatively fragile grip on the world we inhabit, always lurking in the shadows to remind us to keep on our guard. Monsters, then, are a fundamental piece of who we are as a species, reminding us of our past, enticing us to explore far-off lands, while also deterring us from entering treacherous areas, and motivating us to become greater than what we once feared. Even today in our modern era, we continue to tell new stories about monsters, with new generations being challenged, frightened, and inspired by tales of wondrous and inconceivable beasts.\n\n## Bibliography\nBergen, Richard Angelo. “A Warp of Horror”: J.R.R.

Tales of dragon slayers serve as lessons meant to remind us that those who show bravery can overcome any opponent, no matter how monstrous.\n\nAs we have seen, monsters have played many important roles throughout our stories and literature. They can represent deeply hidden aspects of ourselves, reminding us of the potential danger that comes from giving in to our own primal urges. Monsters can also be seen as parallels to the heroes that face them, helping to provide contrast between what is seen as acceptable, and what is monstrous. We take them as an example of what not to do in a civilized context. Another aspect of wondrous and monstrous creatures is that they can be beneficial, drawing in daring adventurers with whispers of their presence in uncharted lands. These same stories of half-man, half-beasts frighten away the faint of heart from potentially dangerous locales, as well as acting as a teaching tool of what happens to those who do not heed the word of God. Arguably the most important role of the monster, though, is to be an enemy whose defeat inspires us to be like the heroes of old. They are embodiments of the trials we have faced to ensure our relatively fragile grip on the world we inhabit, always lurking in the shadows to remind us to keep on our guard. Monsters, then, are a fundamental piece of who we are as a species, reminding us of our past, enticing us to explore far-off lands, while also deterring us from entering treacherous areas, and motivating us to become greater than what we once feared. Even today in our modern era, we continue to tell new stories about monsters, with new generations being challenged, frightened, and inspired by tales of wondrous and inconceivable beasts.\n\n## Bibliography\nBergen, Richard Angelo. “A Warp of Horror”: J.R.R.

Grendel and his mother, along with the fire-dragon, are usually what readers recall about the poem. We often remember the monsters in media more so than the hero, but why is that? Many can easily recall such fearsome adversaries as Smaug, the dragon from <em>The Hobbit</em>, the Kraken from <em>Clash of the Titans</em>, and the Monster from <em>Frankenstein</em>. All of them stand out far more than the protagonists of their stories. It is possible that these creatures represent long-buried aspects of our psyche, thereby speaking to humans on a primal level. They may also serve as incarnations of the other; emissaries from the world that remain just out of sight. Or perhaps, we as a people have an innate desire to create entities to compare ourselves to in order to reassure ourselves about what we hope is our rightful superiority in the world. Through examining the role of the monster in various writings and media, this paper unearths the similarities that connect them across many tales and stories as well as deciphering the hidden importance of monsters.</p>\n<p>In order to closely examine what they may represent, it’s likely that an overview of the monsters within <em>Beowulf</em> would be helpful. The monsters in <em>Beowulf</em> are notoriously undefined, with very few actual descriptions. Grendel and his mother are descended from all manner of strange beings: giants, elves, and ogres. They were brought down from Cain, the first murderer. One aspect that is certain are Grendel’s glowing eyes, a common feature among humanoid monsters that originate in northern England. The dragon stretches over 50-feet in length, but remains uncertain beyond that.</p>\n<p>Yet the poet of <em>Beowulf</em>  reaches beyond limitations of presentation, revealing the inner thoughts of his monsters. Grendel is not a mindless creature, striking at random, but is instead described as acting upon a grudge. The raucous gathering of Danish warriors in King Hrothgar’s new mead hall disturbs him from his seclusion in the wilderness. Grendel’s mother acts according to the honored tradition of blood feud over the slaying of her son. Even the reptilian dragon possesses an interior motivation; we see it obsessively rage over a stolen goblet. We would not be surprised to see such humanizing techniques in a modern horror story, yet this story is over a thousand years old, and is fascinating in its prescience. This aspect of the poem has led to many adaptations that focus on Grendel, the monstrous star of the poem, with varying degrees of success. One notable example of the concept done well is John Gardner’s award-winning novel simply titled <em>Grendel</em>. This work follows the story of Beowulf from the monster’s perspective, presenting a contrast to the warlike Beowulf, in the philosophical Grendel. Having a monster as a protagonist is the pinnacle of creating empathy, and we are given a front-row seat to Grendel’s search for purpose in a seemingly uncaring world. In the end of the novel, our “hero” is reduced to a gibbering wreck after his confrontation with an almost demonic Beowulf, using his last breath to pronounce a curse upon mankind; “Poor Grendel’s had an accident. So may you all” (Gardner 174).</p>\n<p>Despite their exaggerated and frightening features, monsters are often shown to have some small portion of humanity, either in how they act or how they look. This can result in the monsters acting as reflections or representations of different aspects of our psyche. Noted medievalist Jeffrey Cohen was of the opinion that monsters, particularly those that resemble humans, raised questions about our own concepts of identity. He was especially interested in how giants can be considered both human and something other, which is both pre-human and post-human in nature (Cohen 11). Giants appear multiple times across ancient texts, including the Bible, and usually seem to be representations of a time before the rise of humanity, when the world was younger and pristine. This would potentially transform the stories about human heroes slaying giant foes into an allegory for overcoming one’s past in an effort to grow beyond into something new.</p>\n<p><em>Beowulf</em> displays another way monsters can represent parts of humanity, by drawing repeated parallels between Beowulf himself, and the enemies he faces. Grendel and Beowulf are described using similar, even identical terms. For example, they are both characterized as having the strength of 30 men in their arms. When Beowulf does fight human champions, like the Frankish Dæghrefn, his methods are distinctly inhuman, almost monstrous (Orchard 33). Thus, Grendel serves as a dark reflection of what Beowulf might have been, had he forgone all trappings of society- a ravenous, unstoppable menace. The theme of reflection is prevalent throughout the poem, with the mother of Grendel’s watery home being described as a kind of hall, with Beowulf taking the role as invading aggressor in place of Grendel. This flipping of the roles is interesting, as it has Beowulf essentially sinking down to the level of his monstrous foe. Yet ultimately he overcomes the monster, rising to the surface of the swamp grown stronger from his experience. The dragon, fought much later in Beowulf’s life after he has been crowned king, embodies ideals that are the antithesis of what makes a good ruler- unchecked avarice and blind rage at every perceived slight. During their battle, the adjectives between Beowulf and the wyrm are blurred together, both being described with a term that roughly translates to “awe-inspiring,” or “combatant”. The two adversaries eventually kill each other, their bodies intertwined. Beowulf succumbs to the venomous bite of the dragon, and the reptile is finished by a stab through the eye. Monsters, in the context of <em>Beowulf</em>, can then be seen as shadows of Beowulf and his culture, showing the consequences of rejecting society, even twisting the peoples’ traditions to serve their own needs. Perhaps the author intended them to act as a warning to not allow oneself to be consumed by base desires and petty grudges, as these feelings and actions themselves could be considered monstrous. However, the final fate of the aging hero portrays a somber, yet nuanced proposition: that completely overcoming one’s own monstrosity is actually impossible without destroying oneself in the process.</p>\n<p>Monsters, particularly those displayed in travelogues, can be said to be representations of the other and the exotic, inhabiting worlds that are out of sight. In medieval culture they could be said to mark boundaries, both geographical, such as on maps of the world, and anatomical, blurring the lines between human and animal. The allure of potentially seeing these wondrous beasts was likely a driving force behind many of the exploratory and trade expeditions that were undertaken at the time. Monsters can also be seen acting on the complete opposite intention. On the famous <em>mappaemundi</em>, or maps of the world, terrifying sea monsters prowl the waters at the peripheries of the map itself, marking off the boundaries of what was known, possibly deterring sailors from traveling beyond those points. The actual dangers may have been more mundane, such as waterspouts or exposed reefs, but the sea beasts likely demanded people’s attention for a more suitable first impression. Therefore, as markers, monsters may have acted as cautionary signs, intended to keep people from venturing too far from civilization or accepted traditions. Some humanoid monsters, such as the Donestre, with their twisted and animalistic features, were taken to be warnings of what could happen to those who strayed from the teachings of God, becoming as warped physically as they were supposedly spiritually. Indeed, Saint Isidore of Seville trace the word <em>monster</em> to the Latin <em>monere</em>, ‘to warn’, and he suggested that monsters were a warning from God against deviation (Mittman 337). This may partially explain why monsters were considered to be relegated to the distant reaches of the world, having been banished there for violating natural and cultural norms. Saint Augustine had another theory about the root of the word. He traced it to <em>monstrare</em>, “to show,” and declared that monsters were meant to be a demonstration of God’s powers, marking them as necessary parts of the natural order .Monsters, then, could act as both attraction and deterrent, sparking the imagination of entrepreneurs looking to travel to distant lands, while also frightening the “common folk” away from straying too far off the beaten path, lest they be killed in a myriad of gruesome ways. This duality of being both alluring and repulsive seems to be an inherent aspect of the very nature of monstrosity.</p>\n<p>This idea of monsters being from outside the bounds of the normal world appears in <em>Beowulf</em> as well. Grendel and his mother live beneath a marsh far outside Hrothgar’s holdings. They had apparently been dwelling relatively peacefully there for years, before being disturbed by the construction of Heorot. Grendel is even described as a “marsh-stepper” and “border-walker”, further emphasizing his separation from the world of man. His crossing over from his world through the boundaries of Hrothgar’s hall is shown to be an unwelcome and violent attack on the neighboring world of the Danes. Beowulf, monstrous in his physical prowess, is also an outsider, coming from distant Geatland over the ocean waves to aid Hrothgar. This makes Beowulf himself a wondrous being from the lands beyond Daneland, further emphasizing his similarities to his adversaries. He then crosses another boundary, that of the cavernous lair of Grendel’s mother, this time acting as an outside force, much as Grendel did before him. Beowulf is almost killed by Grendel’s mother for his trespass, being saved by what could only be described as a <em>deus ex machina</em>. The dragon incident is another example of borders not being respected, as a thief carelessly invades its lair and carries away a piece of the hoard stashed there, causing the dragon to awaken in a fiery fury. The dragon then departs from its remote lair and terrorizes the people of Geatland, continuing the cycle of disrespecting the boundaries of others’ homelands. After defeating this invader, Beowulf’s final triumph could be argued to be the posthumous erection of his own tomb at the headland, the border, a final way of using his body to mark off his world from that of the monstrous. (Mittman 341) So, in the end, Beowulf, with his prodigious strength, marks the boundary between man and monster, both conceptually, as he displays certain monstrous attributes, and physically, with his tomb acting as a marker for the boundaries of his kingdom.</p>\n<p>The slaying of a monster is often used as a hero’s final obstacle during his journey. By defeating an enemy greater than themselves, he or she shows the growth they experienced over the course of their travels. Monsters are also useful in representing abstract concepts, such as evil and darkness, so by overcoming them, the hero triumphs over evil itself. J.R.R Tolkien was extremely proficient in creating monsters that were embodiments of dark forces that must be combatted. The theme of monstrous creatures of shadow is one of the main elements of Tolkien’s epic <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and its extensions. One of the best examples is Ungoliant, from <em>The Silmarillion</em>, who is a “darkness made visible” monster in the shape of a gargantuan spider. (Bergen 110) Another is the demonic Balrog that menaces the Fellowship while they’re traveling through the abandoned mines of Moria. The Balrog is described as being composed of “shadow and flame” in the vague shape of a humanoid figure, and is only defeated by the sacrifice of the party’s most powerful member, Gandalf, the wizard. Tolkien was very clear about his monsters being intended as embodiments of pure malice and corruption, with no effort made to show any humanizing or empathetic aspects to them. The heroes simply must defeat them, as failure to do so would plunge the world into a shadowy grave. In this context, the monster is merely an obstacle, a physical representation of all the evil in the world that the hero must face.</p>\n<p>Tolkien was also one of the first scholars to argue that the monsters in Beowulf were an essential part of the story, with his contemporaries focusing more on the scarcer historical elements. They felt that the monster fights were “trite” and “unseemly”, but Tolkien disagreed. He argued that the conflict between heroes such as Beowulf, and monsters like Grendel and the dragon, provided important examples of the ever present struggle between good and evil in the world at large. Tolkien, who had been fascinated with dragons since he was a child, also examined the significance of the battle with the mighty beast. “Something more significant than a standard hero, a man faced with a foe more evil than any human enemy of house or realm…” (Tolkien 17) This concept of monsters, particularly dragons, being so far beyond normal man that only a true hero can defeat them, appears multiple times across medieval and Anglo-Saxon literature. In biblical and patristic texts, the dragon features as one of the most common symbols of evil, functioning as a formidable and monstrous adversary of God, man and beast alike. (Rauer 52) Medievalist Christine Rauer compared dozens of dragon fights with the one that takes place in <em>Beowulf</em>, and found several elements shared between them, such as the invasion of the beast’s lair, the dragon’s magnificent treasure hoard, and the ways it is finally defeated, usually with a stab to the underbelly. The dragon perfectly fits the role of a final trial for an aspiring hero, as it combines the most dangerous parts of wild beasts, including the venomous fangs of a serpent and the talons of a massive bird-of-prey, with the perils of a raging inferno. Some scholars have theorized that dragons are a creation of humanity’s subconscious, an amalgamation of the predators we faced during our development as a species.

Arguably the most important role of the monster, though, is to be an enemy whose defeat inspires us to be like the heroes of old. They are embodiments of the trials we have faced to ensure our relatively fragile grip on the world we inhabit, always lurking in the shadows to remind us to keep on our guard. Monsters, then, are a fundamental piece of who we are as a species, reminding us of our past, enticing us to explore far-off lands, while also deterring us from entering treacherous areas, and motivating us to become greater than what we once feared. Even today in our modern era, we continue to tell new stories about monsters, with new generations being challenged, frightened, and inspired by tales of wondrous and inconceivable beasts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Bibliography\"><a href=\"#Bibliography\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Bibliography\"></a>Bibliography</h2><p>Bergen, Richard Angelo. “A Warp of Horror”: J.R.R.

This morning I was ripped from the comfort of my bed by my elder sister, tears streaming down her blackened cheeks. She told me that my parents had been slain, and that the village was under attack. I heard heavy footsteps outside our hut, as if people were marching in unison, weighed down by their armor. I stood, motionless, my heart pounding in my ears. *Is this really happening?* I thought to myself. My sister shook me violently, trying to snap me out of my shocked state. “Do you hear me? *Run!*” She yanked my arm and pushed me out the door with all her might.\n\nA sweet, burning scent filled my lungs as I stumbled onto the dirt. I knew what that was; bitter vomit poured from my mouth. I looked up in alarm as I heard wild screams, beads of sweat dripping from the side of my head. Men hollered left and right, giving orders to burn down huts, seize village men and kill women and children. I looked back at my sister, who was racing around in our room, gathering what armor and weapons she had hidden underneath the bed and on the walls.\n\nThe chaos became a blur around me. Every gut wrenching scream was drowned out by the erratic beat of my heart. The piercing clamor of weaponry dissipated. Bodies lay in groups outside of every hut, their faces frozen in screams, and yet i couldn't register the reality of what I was seeing. They were corpses without a backstory. I was in shock, and therefore disconnected from my brethren who surrounded me.\n\nWithout hesitation, I dashed for the woods to my left. Smoke filled the sky as I weaved between burning huts, the heat of the flames caressing my delicate skin. I ran with everything in me, my legs pumping onto the dirt steadily, even though I felt them tremble every time I raised them up. More men and women fell before me, and I leapt and stumbled over their bodies as I desperately tried to reach my destination. They were like logs to me. *Why is this happening?* My thoughts screamed at me. *I'm scared.*\n\nI think I just heard something.\n\n## October 23, 1998\nI've been in the forest for 20 days now, and I don't know where I'm going. My parents had never instructed me on how to survive in a place like this. They did teach me how to hunt, however, so finding food has never been a problem. It's just been hard to eat lately, considering that my village is most likely ash. I'm alone with my thoughts at all waking hours of the day, and I often wonder if I made the right decision to flee. Did I leave my sister behind to die? My heart aches at the thought.\n\nMy body is constantly under stress, and I'm finding it difficult to provide it with the nutrients it needs. My day generally plays out like this: I'll first find an inconspicuous place to set up camp, then I'll travel on ahead. The more area I can cover, the better. If I get to know my forest, then it should treat me well. Right? I scale trees to look farther on ahead, seeing if there are any bodies of water nearby. The easiest source of food is fish, and yet after I cook it over the fire, I can barely stomach it. I'm growing weaker by the minute.\n\nI don't feel like writing much. Not being able to eat makes me very tired. It's a struggle but I trust that I can do it. It’s life or death.\n\n## February 18th, 1999\n\nSo much has happened in the last few months. I can't believe I'm still alive. No one is going to believe me.\n\nAfter a few weeks of trekking through the forest and mapping out the surrounding area, I came across a very mysterious lake. Occasionally, some brave man or woman would make their way through these areas to hunt big game. Sometimes they might even train for potential combat, returning with stories of things they encountered. I've heard countless stories; from giant wild boars fighting to death, shaking the trees around them, to spirits whispering evil things throughout the night. Out of all the bizarre tales that were told, nothing could have come close to what I encountered.\n\nIt was nearing evening as I hacked away at large brush and hanging mosses. The air was humid and heavy, making it difficult to breathe and stay on my feet. I kept having to force myself to drink. I knew that I had lost the desire to give my body what it needed. I was still in shock at having to make it through the forest alone, unsure of whether I would see my people again.\n\nEventually, I arrived at a still lake, which I stopped to rest at. My legs were boney and shaking from exhaustion. The water was clear and cool, and I could see my reflection very clearly. We stared at one another in silence. I knelt in the cool dirt near that lake, and many hours had passed. The sun had set, and small nocturnal creatures sprung from underneath the tall grasses and ferns. Life was abundant and buzzed, howled and chirped all around me.\n\nAt one point, I began to hear what sounded like a rattling. I was unsure of the direction, and my heart rate spiked with alarm. My body was telling me to flee. Suddenly, a three-headed snake slithered across from me on the other side of the mysterious blue lake. Mist circled around its elongated body, and the three heads stared intently at me, their black tongues forking from their mouths. The head to the right opened its mouth, revealing its long, pointed fangs, and from a small hole in the back of its mouth, it shot out a black sludge. The sludge plunged into the still water, and it immediately changed the crystal blue color to black. *You left your family behind.* A voice hissed in my head. *You're a coward.*\n\nI knelt there, motionless and unblinking. Suddenly the sun rose. Where had the time gone? The left head on the snake began to move next, and it turned its entire body so that I could peer into its ruby red eye. We stared at one another for what seemed like and eternity. Eventually, the black water began to bubble and the snake plunged into it, disappearing beneath.\n\nMany hours had passed once again, and I could feel my energy depleting more and more. Eventually my body stopped shaking, and I slouched further and further downwards, the dirt waiting to engulf me. Eventually I lay on my side next to the lake, which was still as dark as night. Morning turned to afternoon, then afternoon to night. Another creature emerged from the confines of the woods. With every step it took, the earth beneath me rumbled angrily. After stomping its way towards the water, it dipped its head down and began to lap up the toxic liquid. It had two extremely long horns that stretched on either side of its blocky head. After lapping up the black water for a few minutes, it looked up at me with a single, deep brown eye. The other was completely shut, a large scar stretching over it.\n\nThe beast stared at me, and I stared at it. Through its eyes, I saw myself. I was angry at the enemy for destroying the peace that my village offered me. I was angry at myself for fleeing, and angry at the snake for destroying the gentle blue water hidden in the warmth of the forest. I hoisted myself off the dirt, accidentally knocking some in my mouth. It tasted much like the boiled mushrooms my sister used to make for me when I was just a child. I stepped into the water, allowing the blackness to engulf me. My body was torn apart. Fear, anger, doubt and selfishness pulled at my innards. I released a guttural scream, water filling my lungs. It happened in an instant. Then… everything became cold, silent.\n\nThe last thing I remember was waking next to the lake. Alone and scared, I got myself together and made my way back to the camp. My journey still continues, and I still haven't found a way to escape this forest. But mark my words, I will survive, and I will find my way back to my people, wherever they may be.\n","source":"blacklake.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Black Lake\nauthor: Jaslynn Martinez\nheaderimage: img/header-blacklake.jpg\naccenttext: I'm alone with my thoughts at all waking hours of the day, and I often wonder if I made the right decision to flee.\nlayout: article\n---\n## October 3, 1998\nI am finally in a safe place to write.

Life was abundant and buzzed, howled and chirped all around me.</p>\n<p>At one point, I began to hear what sounded like a rattling. I was unsure of the direction, and my heart rate spiked with alarm. My body was telling me to flee. Suddenly, a three-headed snake slithered across from me on the other side of the mysterious blue lake. Mist circled around its elongated body, and the three heads stared intently at me, their black tongues forking from their mouths. The head to the right opened its mouth, revealing its long, pointed fangs, and from a small hole in the back of its mouth, it shot out a black sludge. The sludge plunged into the still water, and it immediately changed the crystal blue color to black. <em>You left your family behind.</em> A voice hissed in my head. <em>You’re a coward.</em></p>\n<p>I knelt there, motionless and unblinking. Suddenly the sun rose. Where had the time gone? The left head on the snake began to move next, and it turned its entire body so that I could peer into its ruby red eye. We stared at one another for what seemed like and eternity. Eventually, the black water began to bubble and the snake plunged into it, disappearing beneath.</p>\n<p>Many hours had passed once again, and I could feel my energy depleting more and more. Eventually my body stopped shaking, and I slouched further and further downwards, the dirt waiting to engulf me. Eventually I lay on my side next to the lake, which was still as dark as night. Morning turned to afternoon, then afternoon to night. Another creature emerged from the confines of the woods. With every step it took, the earth beneath me rumbled angrily. After stomping its way towards the water, it dipped its head down and began to lap up the toxic liquid. It had two extremely long horns that stretched on either side of its blocky head. After lapping up the black water for a few minutes, it looked up at me with a single, deep brown eye. The other was completely shut, a large scar stretching over it.</p>\n<p>The beast stared at me, and I stared at it. Through its eyes, I saw myself. I was angry at the enemy for destroying the peace that my village offered me. I was angry at myself for fleeing, and angry at the snake for destroying the gentle blue water hidden in the warmth of the forest. I hoisted myself off the dirt, accidentally knocking some in my mouth. It tasted much like the boiled mushrooms my sister used to make for me when I was just a child. I stepped into the water, allowing the blackness to engulf me. My body was torn apart. Fear, anger, doubt and selfishness pulled at my innards. I released a guttural scream, water filling my lungs. It happened in an instant. Then… everything became cold, silent.</p>\n<p>The last thing I remember was waking next to the lake. Alone and scared, I got myself together and made my way back to the camp. My journey still continues, and I still haven’t found a way to escape this forest. But mark my words, I will survive, and I will find my way back to my people, wherever they may be.</p>\n"},{"title":"Develish Wishes","author":"Joseph

advance in areas such as digital studies and writing. One such person is Travis DuBose, who introduced our small but ever-growing campus to *The Scarlet Review*, back in 2015. Here is where the magic happens, as cliche as that may sound. Students who enroll in DuBose’s course, *Digital Publishing*, get to create the new issue of the literary magazine by selecting works from author submissions, designing the website, and editing and copyediting pieces. With DuBose’s guidance, in other words, students get the first-hand experience in this world. I suppose what I am trying to point out is that the students and advisory involving this issue, as well as past issues, diligently give this magazine their all. Not only just to offer an enjoyable reading experience to the campus, but to also properly publish student authors’ work with the respect they deserve.\n\nYet, I believe that our team this year went above and beyond for the 2019 issue of *The Scarlet Review*. The entire staff worked together to formulate new ideas, such as taking the magazine out of its comfort zone by diversifying the design, the contents, and even involving social media and a public reading. Surprisingly, our team was continuously on the same page in terms of what we wanted this issue to be. We agreed that we wanted *The Scarlet Review* this year to not hold back and to be the closest depiction we could muster of the world we currently reside in. This job was far from easy. As a team, we were only able to accept a certain number of pieces, and despite our big ideas and input, there were still restrictions due to the timing we had to create this issue. We also had to take into consideration the fact that we were still in a class through the University.\n\nI am going to be cliche once again and conclude this with one of the most notorious quotes in history, by none other than Gandhi himself: “You must be the change you want to see in the world.” The authors of these pieces expressed their true emotions and thoughts in a time where, more than ever, those emotions and thoughts are urged to be swallowed. The authors of this issue very creatively touched upon real-world trials such as racism, internal battles, mental illness, love, and many others, bravely speaking into a continuously-darkening tunnel. Where we are right now in the world is horrifying, there are trials happening as I type this, and as you are reading it. Yet, these authors were given a gift so strong that will change the way people view the world, and that gift is writing. Therefore, I give an overly powerful thank you to the authors of this year’s *The Scarlet Review* who were fearless in their words, to the staff who worked endlessly to make this issue outstanding, to the advisor who took time to guide and create, and to the readers who give meaning to all of this.
